ovn-nb \- OVN_Northbound database schema
.PP
This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system
(CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it\[char46]  The CMS produces almost all of
the contents of the database\[char46]  The \fBovn\-northd\fR program
monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the \fBOVN_Southbound\fR database\[char46]
.PP
We generally speak of ``the\(cq\(cq CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment\[char46]

Each of the tables in this database contains a special column, named
\fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46]  This column has the same form and purpose each
place it appears\[char46]
.RS

\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs

.IP "\fBname\fR: string (must be unique within table)"
The logical port name\[char46]
.IP
For entities (VMs or containers) that are spawned in the hypervisor,
the name used here must match those used in the \fBexternal_ids:iface-id\fR in the
\fBOpen_vSwitch\fR database\(cqs \fBInterface\fR table, because hypervisors use \fBexternal_ids:iface-id\fR as a lookup
key to identify the network interface of that entity\[char46]
.IP
For containers that share a VIF within a VM, the name can be any
unique identifier\[char46]  See \fBContainers\fR, below, for more
information\[char46]
.IP "\fBtype\fR: string"
Specify a type for this logical port\[char46]  Logical ports can be used to
model other types of connectivity into an OVN logical switch\[char46]  The
following types are defined:
.RS
.TP
(empty string)
A VM (or VIF) interface\[char46]
.TP
\fBrouter\fR
A connection to a logical router\[char46]
.TP
\fBlocalnet\fR
A connection to a locally accessible network from each
\fBovn\-controller\fR instance\[char46]  A logical switch can only
have a single \fBlocalnet\fR port attached and at most one
regular logical port\[char46]  This is used to model direct connectivity to
an existing network\[char46]
.TP
\fBvtep\fR
A port to a logical switch on a VTEP gateway\[char46]
.RE
.ST "Options:"
.IP "\fBoptions\fR: map of string-string pairs"
This column provides key/value settings specific to the logical port
\fBtype\fR\[char46]  The type-specific options are described
individually below\[char46]
.ST "Options for router ports:"
These options apply when \fBtype\fR is \fBrouter\fR\[char46]
.PP
If a given logical switch has multiple \fBrouter\fR ports, the
\fBLogical_Router_Port\fR rows that they reference must be
all on the same \fBLogical_Router\fR (for different
subnets)\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions : router-port\fR: optional string"
Required\[char46]  The \fBname\fR of the \fBLogical_Router_Port\fR to which this logical switch port is
connected\[char46]
.ST "Options for localnet ports:"
These options apply when \fBtype\fR is
\fBlocalnet\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions : network_name\fR: optional string"
Required\[char46]  The name of the network to which the \fBlocalnet\fR
port is connected\[char46]  Each hypervisor, via \fBovn\-controller\fR,
uses its local configuration to determine exactly how to connect to
this locally accessible network\[char46]
.ST "Options for vtep ports:"
These options apply when \fBtype\fR is \fBvtep\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions : vtep-physical-switch\fR: optional string"
Required\[char46]  The name of the VTEP gateway\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions : vtep-logical-switch\fR: optional string"
Required\[char46]  A logical switch name connected by the VTEP gateway\[char46]
.ST "Containers:"
When a large number of containers are nested within a VM, it may be too
expensive to dedicate a VIF to each container\[char46]  OVN can use VLAN tags
to support such cases\[char46]  Each container is assigned a VLAN ID and each
packet that passes between the hypervisor and the VM is tagged with the
appropriate ID for the container\[char46]  Such VLAN IDs never appear on a
physical wire, even inside a tunnel, so they need not be unique except
relative to a single VM on a hypervisor\[char46]
.PP
These columns are used for VIFs that represent nested containers using
shared VIFs\[char46]  For VMs and for containers that have dedicated VIFs, they
are empty\[char46]
.IP "\fBparent_name\fR: optional string"
The VM interface through which the nested container sends its network
traffic\[char46]  This must match the \fBname\fR column for some
other \fBLogical_Port\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBtag\fR: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095"
The VLAN tag in the network traffic associated with a container\(cqs
network interface\[char46]
.IP
When \fBtype\fR is set to \fBlocalnet\fR, this can
be set to indicate that the port represents a connection to a
specific VLAN on a locally accessible network\[char46] The VLAN ID is used to
match incoming traffic and is also added to outgoing traffic\[char46]
.ST "Port State:"
.IP "\fBup\fR: optional boolean"
This column is populated by \fBovn\-northd\fR, rather than by the
CMS plugin as is most of this database\[char46]  When a logical port is bound
to a physical location in the OVN Southbound database \fBBinding\fR table, \fBovn\-northd\fR
sets this column to \fBtrue\fR; otherwise, or if the port
becomes unbound later, it sets it to \fBfalse\fR\[char46]  This allows
the CMS to wait for a VM\(cqs (or container\(cqs) networking to become active
before it allows the VM (or container) to start\[char46]
.IP "\fBenabled\fR: optional boolean"
This column is used to administratively set port state\[char46]  If this column
is empty or is set to \fBtrue\fR, the port is enabled\[char46]  If this
column is set to \fBfalse\fR, the port is disabled\[char46]  A disabled
port has all ingress and egress traffic dropped\[char46]
.ST "Addressing:"
.IP "\fBaddresses\fR: set of strings"
Addresses owned by the logical port\[char46]
.IP
Each element in the set must take one of the following forms:
.RS
.TP
\fB\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB\fR
An Ethernet address owned by the logical port\[char46]  Like a physical
Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has a single fixed
Ethernet address\[char46]
.IP
When a OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet frame
whose destination MAC address is in a logical port\(cqs \fBaddresses\fR column, it delivers it only to that port, as
if a MAC learning process had learned that MAC address on the
port\[char46]
.TP
\fB\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB:\fIxx\fB \fIa\fB\[char46]\fIb\fB\[char46]\fIc\fB\[char46]\fId\fB\fR
This form has all the effects of the previous form\[char46]  It also
indicates that the logical port owns the given IPv4 address\[char46]
.IP
The OVN logical switch uses this information to synthesize
responses to ARP requests without traversing the physical
network\[char46]  The OVN logical router connected to the logical switch,
if any, uses this information to avoid issuing ARP requests for
logical switch ports\[char46]
.IP
Note that the order here is important\[char46] The Ethernet address must
be listed before the IP address\[char46]
.TP
\fBunknown\fR
This indicates that the logical port has an unknown set of Ethernet
addresses\[char46]  When an OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet
frame whose destination MAC address is not in any logical port\(cqs
\fBaddresses\fR column, it delivers it to the port (or
ports) whose \fBaddresses\fR columns include
\fBunknown\fR\[char46]
.RE
.IP "\fBport_security\fR: set of strings"
A set of L2 (Ethernet) addresses from which the logical port is
allowed to send packets and to which it is allowed to receive
packets\[char46]  If this column is empty, all addresses are permitted\[char46]
Logical ports are always allowed to receive packets addressed to
multicast and broadcast addresses\[char46]
.IP
Each member of the set is an Ethernet address in the form
\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR\[char46]
.IP
This specification will be extended to support L3 port security\[char46]

Each row in this table represents one ACL rule for a logical switch
that points to it through its \fBacls\fR column\[char46]  The \fBaction\fR column for the highest-\fBpriority\fR

matches, packets are allowed by default\[char46]  (Default-deny treatment is
