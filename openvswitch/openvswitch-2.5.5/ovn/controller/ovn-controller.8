ovn-controller \- Open Virtual Network local controller
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIovs-database\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR is the local controller daemon for
OVN, the Open Virtual Network\[char46]  It connects up to the OVN
Southbound database (see \fBovn\-sb\fR(5)) over the OVSDB
protocol, and down to the Open vSwitch database (see
\fBovs\-vswitchd\[char46]conf\[char46]db\fR(5)) over the OVSDB protocol and
to \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR(8) via OpenFlow\[char46]  Each hypervisor and
software gateway in an OVN deployment runs its own independent
copy of \fBovn\-controller\fR; thus,
\fBovn\-controller\fR\(cqs downward connections are
machine-local and do not run over a physical network\[char46]
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR retrieves most of its configuration
information from the local Open vSwitch\(cqs ovsdb-server instance\[char46]
The default location is \fBdb\[char46]sock\fR in the local Open
vSwitch\(cqs \(dqrun\(dq directory\[char46]  It may be overridden by specifying the
\fIovs-database\fR argument in one of the following forms:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBssl:\fIip\fB:\fIport\fB\fR
.IP
The specified SSL \fIport\fR on the host at the given
\fIip\fR, which must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS
name) in IPv4 or IPv6 address format\[char46]  If \fIip\fR is an IPv6
address, then wrap \fIip\fR with square brackets, e\[char46]g\[char46]:
\fBssl:[::1]:6640\fR\[char46]  The \fB\-\-private\-key\fR,
\fB\-\-certificate\fR and either of \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR
or \fB\-\-bootstrap\-ca\-cert\fR options are mandatory when this
form is used\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fBtcp:\fIip\fB:\fIport\fB\fR
.IP
Connect to the given TCP \fIport\fR on \fIip\fR, where
\fIip\fR can be IPv4 or IPv6 address\[char46] If \fIip\fR is an
IPv6 address, then wrap \fIip\fR with square brackets, e\[char46]g\[char46]:
\fBtcp:[::1]:6640\fR\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fBunix:\fIfile\fB\fR
.IP
On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket named
\fIfile\fR\[char46]
.IP
On Windows, connect to a localhost TCP port whose value is written
in \fIfile\fR\[char46]
.RE
.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR assumes it gets configuration
information from the following keys in the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR
table of the local OVS instance:
.RS
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:system\-id\fR
The chassis name to use in the Chassis table\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-bridge\fR
The integration bridge to which logical ports are attached\[char46]  The
default is \fBbr\-int\fR\[char46]  If this bridge does not exist when
ovn-controller starts, it will be created automatically with the
default configuration suggested in \fBovn\-architecture\fR(7)\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-remote\fR
The OVN database that this system should connect to for its
configuration\[char46]
.IP
Currently, \fBovn\-controller\fR does not support changing this
setting mid-run\[char46]  If the value needs to change, the daemon must be
restarted\[char46]  (This behavior should be improved\[char46])
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-encap\-type\fR
The encapsulation type that a chassis should use to connect to
this node\[char46]  Multiple encapsulation types may be specified with
a comma-separated list\[char46]  Each listed encapsulation type will
be paired with \fBovn\-encap\-ip\fR\[char46]
.IP
Supported tunnel types for connecting hypervisors
are \fBgeneve\fR and \fBstt\fR\[char46]  Gateways may
use \fBgeneve\fR, \fBvxlan\fR, or
\fBstt\fR\[char46]
.IP
Due to the limited amount of metadata in \fBvxlan\fR,
the capabilities and performance of connected gateways will be
reduced versus other tunnel formats\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-encap\-ip\fR
The IP address that a chassis should use to connect to this node
using encapsulation types specified by
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-encap\-type\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-bridge\-mappings\fR
A list of key-value pairs that map a physical network name to a local
ovs bridge that provides connectivity to that network\[char46]  An example
value mapping two physical network names to two ovs bridges would be:
\fBphysnet1:br\-eth0,physnet2:br\-eth1\fR\[char46]
.RE
.SH "OPEN VSWITCH DATABASE USAGE"
.PP
\fBovn\-controller\fR uses a number of \fBexternal\-ids\fR
keys in the Open vSwitch database to keep track of ports and interfaces\[char46]
For proper operation, users should not change or clear these keys:
.RS
.TP
\fBexternal_ids:ovn\-chassis\-id\fR in the \fBPort\fR table
The presence of this key identifies a tunnel port within the
integration bridge as one created by \fBovn\-controller\fR to
reach a remote chassis\[char46]  Its value is the chassis ID of the remote
chassis\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal\-ids:ovn\-localnet\-port\fR in the \fBPort\fR
table
The presence of this key identifies a patch port as one created by
\fBovn\-controller\fR to connect the integration bridge and
another bridge to implement a \fBlocalnet\fR logical port\[char46]
Its value is the name of the physical network that the port
implements\[char46]  See \fBexternal_ids:ovn\-bridge\-mappings\fR,
above, for more information\[char46]
.IP
Each \fBlocalnet\fR logical port is implemented as a pair of
patch ports, one in the integration bridge, one in a different
bridge, with the same \fBexternal\-ids:ovn\-localnet\-port\fR
value\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal\-ids:ovn\-logical\-patch\-port\fR in the
\fBPort\fR table
This key identifies a patch port as one created by
\fBovn\-controller\fR to implement an OVN logical patch port
within the integration bridge\[char46]  Its value is the name of the OVN
logical patch port that it implements\[char46]
.RE
.SH "RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS"
.PP
\fBovs\-appctl\fR can send commands to a running
\fBovn\-controller\fR process\[char46]  The currently supported
commands are described below\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBexit\fR
Causes \fBovn\-controller\fR to gracefully terminate\[char46]
.TP
\fBct\-zone\-list\fR
Lists each local logical port and its connection tracking zone\[char46]
