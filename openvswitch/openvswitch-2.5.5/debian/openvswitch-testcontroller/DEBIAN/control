Description: Simple controller for testing OpenFlow setups
 This controller enables OpenFlow switches that connect to it to act
 as MAC-learning Ethernet switches.  It can be used for initial
 testing of OpenFlow networks.  It is not a necessary or desirable
 part of a production OpenFlow deployment.
