The physical switch or switches managed by the VTEP\[char46]
.IP
When a physical switch integrates support for this VTEP schema, which
is expected to be the most common case, this column should point to one
\fBPhysical_Switch\fR record that represents the switch
itself\[char46]  In another possible implementation, a server or a VM presents
a VTEP schema front-end interface to one or more physical switches,
presumably communicating with those physical switches over a
proprietary protocol\[char46]  In that case, this column would point to one
\fBPhysical_Switch\fR for each physical switch, and the set
might change over time as the front-end server comes to represent a
differing set of switches\[char46]

.ST "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD):"
BFD, defined in RFC 5880, allows point to point detection of
connectivity failures by occasional transmission of BFD control
messages\[char46] VTEPs are expected to implement BFD\[char46]
.PP
BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a
rate negotiated independently in each direction\[char46]  Each endpoint
specifies the rate at which it expects to receive control messages,
and the rate at which it\(cqs willing to transmit them\[char46]  An endpoint
which fails to receive BFD control messages for a period of three
times the expected reception rate will signal a connectivity
fault\[char46]  In the case of a unidirectional connectivity issue, the
system not receiving BFD control messages will signal the problem
to its peer in the messages it transmits\[char46]
.PP
A hardware VTEP is expected to use BFD to determine reachability of
devices at the end of the tunnels with which it exchanges data\[char46] This
can enable the VTEP to choose a functioning service node among a set of
service nodes providing high availability\[char46] It also enables the NVC to
report the health status of tunnels\[char46]
.PP
In many cases the BFD peer of a hardware VTEP will be an Open vSwitch
instance\[char46] The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to comply
faithfully with the requirements put forth in RFC 5880\[char46]  Open vSwitch
does not implement the optional Authentication or ``Echo Mode\(cq\(cq
features\[char46]
.ST "BFD Local Configuration:"
The HSC writes the key-value pairs in the

.IP "\fBbfd_params : min_tx\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD session is

receive as quickly as specified\[char46]  Defaults to \fB100\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBbfd_params : decay_min_rx\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
An alternate receive interval, in milliseconds, that must be greater

.IP "\fBbfd_params : cpath_down\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Set to true to notify the remote endpoint that traffic should not be
forwarded to this system for some reason other than a connectivity
failure on the interface being monitored\[char46]  The typical underlying
reason is ``concatenated path down,\(cq\(cq that is, that connectivity

the BFD monitoring on the other side of the tunnel once this

If, for example, the map contains a (VLAN, logical switch) pair, a packet
that arrives on the port in the VLAN is considered to belong to the
paired logical switch\[char46] A value of zero in the VLAN field means
that untagged traffic on the physical port is mapped to the

Attach Access Control Lists (ACLs) to the physical port\[char46] The

associated with the entire physical port\[char46] Non-zero values mean
that the ACL is to be applied only on packets carrying that VLAN
tag value\[char46] Switches will not necessarily support matching on the
VLAN tag for all ACLs, and unsupported ACL bindings will cause
errors to be reported\[char46] The binding of an ACL to a specific
