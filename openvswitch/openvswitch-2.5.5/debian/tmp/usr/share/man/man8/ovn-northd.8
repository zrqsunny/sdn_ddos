.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBovn\-northd\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBovn\-northd\fR is a centralized daemon responsible for
translating the high-level OVN configuration into logical
configuration consumable by daemons such as
\fBovn\-controller\fR\[char46]  It translates the logical network
configuration in terms of conventional network concepts, taken
from the OVN Northbound Database (see \fBovn\-nb\fR(5)),
into logical datapath flows in the OVN Southbound Database (see
\fBovn\-sb\fR(5)) below it\[char46]
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
\fBovn\-northd\fR requires a connection to the Northbound
and Southbound databases\[char46]  The default is \fBdb\[char46]sock\fR
in the local Open vSwitch\(cqs \(dqrun\(dq directory\[char46]  This may be
overridden with the following commands:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fB\-\-ovnnb\-db=\fIdatabase\fB\fR
.IP
The database containing the OVN Northbound Database\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fB\-\-ovsnb\-db=\fIdatabase\fB\fR

.RE
.PP
The \fIdatabase\fR argument must take one of the following forms:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBssl:\fIip\fB:\fIport\fB\fR
.IP
The specified SSL \fIport\fR on the host at the given
\fIip\fR, which must be expressed as an IP address (not a DNS
name) in IPv4 or IPv6 address format\[char46]  If \fIip\fR is an IPv6
address, then wrap \fIip\fR with square brackets, e\[char46]g\[char46]:
\fBssl:[::1]:6640\fR\[char46]  The \fB\-\-private\-key\fR,
\fB\-\-certificate\fR, and \fB\-\-ca\-cert\fR options are
mandatory when this form is used\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fBtcp:\fIip\fB:\fIport\fB\fR
.IP
Connect to the given TCP \fIport\fR on \fIip\fR, where
\fIip\fR can be IPv4 or IPv6 address\[char46] If \fIip\fR is an
IPv6 address, then wrap \fIip\fR with square brackets, e\[char46]g\[char46]:
\fBtcp:[::1]:6640\fR\[char46]

One of the main purposes of \fBovn\-northd\fR is to populate the

for switch and router logical datapaths\[char46]
.SS "Logical Switch Datapaths"
.ST "Ingress Table 0: Admission Control and Ingress Port Security"
.PP
Ingress table 0 contains these logical flows:
.RS
.IP \(bu
Priority 100 flows to drop packets with VLAN tags or multicast Ethernet
source addresses\[char46]
.IP \(bu
Priority 50 flows that implement ingress port security for each enabled
logical port\[char46]  For logical ports on which port security is enabled,
these match the \fBinport\fR and the valid \fBeth\[char46]src\fR
address(es) and advance only those packets to the next flow table\[char46]  For
logical ports on which port security is not enabled, these advance all
packets that match the \fBinport\fR\[char46]
.RE
.PP
There are no flows for disabled logical ports because the default-drop
behavior of logical flow tables causes packets that ingress from them to
be dropped\[char46]
.ST "Ingress Table 1: \fBfrom\-lport\fR Pre-ACLs"
.PP
Ingress table 1 prepares flows for possible stateful ACL processing
in table 2\[char46]  It contains a priority\-0 flow that simply moves
traffic to table 2\[char46]  If stateful ACLs are used in the logical
datapath, a priority\-100 flow is added that sends IP packets to
the connection tracker before advancing to table 2\[char46]
.ST "Ingress table 2: \fBfrom\-lport\fR ACLs"
.PP
Logical flows in this table closely reproduce those in the
\fBACL\fR table in the \fBOVN_Northbound\fR database
for the \fBfrom\-lport\fR direction\[char46]  \fBallow\fR
ACLs translate into logical flows with the \fBnext;\fR
action, \fBallow\-related\fR ACLs translate into logical
flows with the \fBct_next;\fR action, other ACLs translate
to \fBdrop;\fR\[char46]  The \fBpriority\fR values from the
\fBACL\fR table are used directly\[char46]
.PP
Ingress table 2 also contains a priority 0 flow with action
\fBnext;\fR, so that ACLs allow packets by default\[char46]  If the
logical datapath has a statetful ACL, the following flows will
also be added:
.RS
.IP \(bu
A priority\-1 flow to commit IP traffic to the connection
tracker\[char46]  This is needed for the default allow policy because,
while the initiater\(cqs direction may not have any stateful rules,
the server\(cqs may and then its return traffic would not be known
and marked as invalid\[char46]
.IP \(bu
A priority\-65535 flow that allows any traffic that has been
committed to the connection tracker (i\[char46]e\[char46], established flows)\[char46]
.IP \(bu
A priority\-65535 flow that allows any traffic that is considered
related to a committed flow in the connection tracker (e\[char46]g\[char46], an
ICMP Port Unreachable from a non-listening UDP port)\[char46]
.IP \(bu
A priority\-65535 flow that drops all traffic marked by the
connection tracker as invalid\[char46]
.RE
.ST "Ingress Table 3: Destination Lookup"
.PP
This table implements switching behavior\[char46]  It contains these logical
flows:
.RS
.IP \(bu
A priority\-100 flow that outputs all packets with an Ethernet broadcast
or multicast \fBeth\[char46]dst\fR to the \fBMC_FLOOD\fR
multicast group, which \fBovn\-northd\fR populates with all
enabled logical ports\[char46]
.IP \(bu
One priority\-50 flow that matches each known Ethernet address against
\fBeth\[char46]dst\fR and outputs the packet to the single associated
output port\[char46]
.IP \(bu
One priority\-0 fallback flow that matches all packets and outputs them
to the \fBMC_UNKNOWN\fR multicast group, which
\fBovn\-northd\fR populates with all enabled logical ports that
accept unknown destination packets\[char46]  As a small optimization, if no
logical ports accept unknown destination packets,
\fBovn\-northd\fR omits this multicast group and logical flow\[char46]

.PP
This is similar to ingress table 2 except for \fBto\-lport\fR ACLs\[char46]
.ST "Egress Table 2: Egress Port Security"
.PP
This is similar to the ingress port security logic in ingress table 0,
but with important differences\[char46]  Most obviously, \fBoutport\fR and
\fBeth\[char46]dst\fR are checked instead of \fBinport\fR and
\fBeth\[char46]src\fR\[char46]  Second, packets directed to broadcast or multicast
\fBeth\[char46]dst\fR are always accepted instead of being subject to the
port security rules; this is implemented through a priority\-100 flow that
matches on \fBeth\[char46]mcast\fR with action \fBoutput;\fR\[char46]
Finally, to ensure that even broadcast and multicast packets are not
delivered to disabled logical ports, a priority\-150 flow for each
disabled logical \fBoutport\fR overrides the priority\-100 flow
with a \fBdrop;\fR action\[char46]
