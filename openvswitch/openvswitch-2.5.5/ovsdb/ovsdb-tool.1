.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBovsdb\-tool\fR program is a command-line tool for managing Open
vSwitch database (OVSDB) files.  It does not interact directly with
running Open vSwitch database servers (instead, use
\fBovsdb\-client\fR).
.
.SS "Basic Commands"
.IP "\fBcreate\fI db schema\fR"
Reads an OVSDB schema from the file named \fIschema\fR and creates a
new OVSDB database file named \fIdb\fR using that schema.  The new
database is initially empty.  This command will not overwrite an
existing \fIdb\fR.
.IP
\fIschema\fR must contain an OVSDB schema in JSON format.  Refer to
the OVSDB specification for details.
.
.IP "\fBcompact\fI db \fR[\fItarget\fR]"
Reads \fIdb\fR and writes a compacted version.  If \fItarget\fR is
specified, the compacted version is written as a new file named
\fItarget\fR, which must not already exist.  If \fItarget\fR is
omitted, then the compacted version of the database replaces \fIdb\fR
in-place.
.
.IP "\fBconvert\fI db schema \fR[\fItarget\fR]"
Reads \fIdb\fR, translating it into to the schema specified in
\fIschema\fR, and writes out the new interpretation.  If \fItarget\fR
is specified, the translated version is written as a new file named
\fItarget\fR, which must not already exist.  If \fItarget\fR is
omitted, then the translated version of the database replaces \fIdb\fR
in-place.
.IP
This command can do simple ``upgrades'' and ``downgrades'' on a
database's schema.  The data in \fIdb\fR must be valid when
interpreted under \fIschema\fR, with only one exception: data in
\fIdb\fR for tables and columns that do not exist in \fIschema\fR are
ignored.  Columns that exist in \fIschema\fR but not in \fIdb\fR are
set to their default values.  All of \fIschema\fR's constraints apply
in full.
.
.IP "\fBneeds\-conversion\fI db schema\fR"
Reads the schema embedded in \fIdb\fR and the standalone schema in
\fIschema\fR and compares them.  If the schemas are the same, prints
\fBno\fR on stdout; if they differ, print \fByes\fR.
.
.IP "\fBdb\-version\fI db\fR"
.IQ "\fBschema\-version\fI schema\fR"
Prints the version number in the schema embedded within the database
\fIdb\fR or in the standalone schema \fIschema\fR on stdout.  A schema
version number has the form \fIx\fB.\fIy\fB.\fIz\fR.  See
\fBovs\-vswitchd.conf.db\fR(5) for details.
.IP
Schema version numbers and Open vSwitch version numbers are
independent.
.IP
If \fIschema\fR or \fIdb\fR was created before schema versioning was
introduced, then it will not have a version number and this command
will print a blank line.
.
.IP "\fBdb\-cksum\fI db\fR"
.IQ "\fBschema\-cksum\fI schema\fR"
Prints the checksum in the schema embedded within the database
\fIdb\fR or of the standalone schema \fIschema\fR on stdout.
.IP
If \fIschema\fR or \fIdb\fR was created before schema checksums were
introduced, then it will not have a checksum and this command
will print a blank line.
.
.IP "\fBquery\fI db transaction\fR"
Opens \fIdb\fR, executes \fItransaction\fR on it, and prints the
results.  The \fItransaction\fR must be a JSON array in the format of
the \fBparams\fR array for the JSON-RPC \fBtransact\fR method, as
described in the OVSDB specification.
.IP
The \fIdb\fR is opened for read-only access, so this command may
safely run concurrently with other database activity, including
\fBovsdb\-server\fR and other database writers.  The \fItransaction\fR
may specify database modifications, but these will have no effect on
\fIdb\fR.
.
.IP "\fBtransact\fI db transaction\fR"
Opens \fIdb\fR, executes \fItransaction\fR on it, prints the results,
and commits any changes to \fIdb\fR.  The \fItransaction\fR must be a
JSON array in the format of the \fBparams\fR array for the JSON-RPC
\fBtransact\fR method, as described in the OVSDB specification.
.IP
The \fIdb\fR is opened and locked for read/write access, so this
command will fail if the database is opened for writing by any other
process, including \fBovsdb\-server\fR(1).  Use \fBovsdb\-client\fR(1),
instead, to write to a database that is served by
\fBovsdb\-server\fR(1).
.
.IP "\fBshow\-log\fI db\fR"
Prints a summary of the records in \fIdb\fR's log, including the time
and date at which each database change occurred and any associated
comment.  This may be useful for debugging.
.IP
To increase the verbosity of output, add \fB\-m\fR (or \fB\-\-more\fR)
one or more times to the command line.  With one \fB\-m\fR,
\fBshow\-log\fR prints a summary of the records added, deleted, or
modified by each transaction.  With two \fB\-m\fRs, \fBshow\-log\fR
also prints the values of the columns modified by each change to a
record.

.  br
.  ns
.  IP "\\$1"
..
.IP "\fB\-v\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.
Sets logging levels.  Without any \fIspec\fR, sets the log level for
every module and destination to \fBdbg\fR.  Otherwise, \fIspec\fR is a
list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
each category below:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
A valid module name, as displayed by the \fBvlog/list\fR command on
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR, to limit the log level
change to only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
respectively.  (If \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, \fB\*(PN\fR closes
its standard file descriptors, so logging to the console will have no
effect.)
.IP
On Windows platform, \fBsyslog\fR is accepted as a word and is only
useful along with the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option (the word has no
effect otherwise).
.
.IP \(bu
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or
\fBdbg\fR, to control the log level.  Messages of the given severity
or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be
filtered out.  \fBoff\fR filters out all messages.  See
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level.
.RE
.
.IP
Case is not significant within \fIspec\fR.
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file
will not take place unless \fB\-\-log\-file\fR is also specified (see
below).
.IP
For compatibility with older versions of OVS, \fBany\fR is accepted as
a word but has no effect.
.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose\fR"
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
\fB\-\-verbose=dbg\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vPATTERN:\fIdestination\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=PATTERN:\fIdestination\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
Sets the log pattern for \fIdestination\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Refer to
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a description of the valid syntax for \fIpattern\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-vFACILITY:\fIfacility\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=FACILITY:\fIfacility\fR"
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message. \fIfacility\fR can be one of
\fBkern\fR, \fBuser\fR, \fBmail\fR, \fBdaemon\fR, \fBauth\fR, \fBsyslog\fR,
\fBlpr\fR, \fBnews\fR, \fBuucp\fR, \fBclock\fR, \fBftp\fR, \fBntp\fR,
\fBaudit\fR, \fBalert\fR, \fBclock2\fR, \fBlocal0\fR, \fBlocal1\fR,
\fBlocal2\fR, \fBlocal3\fR, \fBlocal4\fR, \fBlocal5\fR, \fBlocal6\fR or
\fBlocal7\fR. If this option is not specified, \fBdaemon\fR is used as
the default for the local system syslog and \fBlocal0\fR is used while sending
a message to the target provided via the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR[\fB=\fIfile\fR]
Enables logging to a file.  If \fIfile\fR is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file.  The default log file name
used if \fIfile\fR is omitted is \fB/var/log/openvswitch/\*(PN.log\fR.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-target=\fIhost\fB:\fIport\fR"
Send syslog messages to UDP \fIport\fR on \fIhost\fR, in addition to
the system syslog.  The \fIhost\fR must be a numerical IP address, not
a hostname.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslog\-method=\fImethod\fR"
Specify \fImethod\fR how syslog messages should be sent to syslog daemon.
Following forms are supported:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBlibc\fR, use libc \fBsyslog()\fR function.  This is the default behavior.
Downside of using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every
message before it is actually sent to the syslog daemon over \fB/dev/log\fR
UNIX domain socket.
.IP \(bu
\fBunix:\fIfile\fR\fR, use UNIX domain socket directly.  It is possible to
specify arbitrary message format with this option.  However,
\fBrsyslogd 8.9\fR and older versions use hard coded parser function anyway
that limits UNIX domain socket use.  If you want to use arbitrary message
format with older \fBrsyslogd\fR versions, then use UDP socket to localhost
IP address instead.
.IP \(bu
\fBudp:\fIip\fR:\fIport\fR\fR, use UDP socket.  With this method it is
possible to use arbitrary message format also with older \fBrsyslogd\fR.
When sending syslog messages over UDP socket extra precaution needs to
be taken into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to be configured
to listen on the specified UDP port, accidental iptables rules could be
interfering with local syslog traffic and there are some security
considerations that apply to UDP sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain
sockets.
