ovs-vswitchd\[char46]conf\[char46]db \- Open_vSwitch database schema
.PP
A database with this schema holds the configuration for one Open
vSwitch daemon\[char46]  The top-level configuration for the daemon is the
\fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table, which must have exactly one
record\[char46]  Records in other tables are significant only when they
can be reached directly or indirectly from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table\[char46]  Records that are not reachable from
the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table are automatically deleted
from the database, except for records in a few distinguished
``root set\(cq\(cq tables\[char46]
.SS "Common Columns"
.PP
Most tables contain two special columns, named \fBother_config\fR
and \fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46]  These columns have the same form and
purpose each place that they appear, so we describe them here to save space
later\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBother_config\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for configuring rarely used features\[char46]  Supported keys,
along with the forms taken by their values, are documented individually
for each table\[char46]
.IP
A few tables do not have \fBother_config\fR columns because no
key-value pairs have yet been defined for them\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that integrate with Open
vSwitch, rather than by Open vSwitch itself\[char46]  System integrators should
either use the Open vSwitch development mailing list to coordinate on
common key-value definitions, or choose key names that are likely to be
unique\[char46]  In some cases, where key-value pairs have been defined that are
likely to be widely useful, they are documented individually for each
table\[char46]

SSL used globally by the daemon\[char46]
.IP "\fBexternal_ids : system-id\fR: optional string"
A unique identifier for the Open vSwitch\(cqs physical host\[char46]
The form of the identifier depends on the type of the host\[char46]
On a Citrix XenServer, this will likely be the same as
\fBexternal_ids:xs-system-uuid\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBexternal_ids : xs-system-uuid\fR: optional string"
The Citrix XenServer universally unique identifier for the physical

.IP "\fBother_config : stats-update-interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 5,000"
Interval for updating statistics to the database, in milliseconds\[char46]
This option will affect the update of the \fBstatistics\fR
column in the following tables: \fBPort\fR, \fBInterface
\fR, \fBMirror\fR\[char46]
.IP
Default value is 5000 ms\[char46]
.IP
Getting statistics more frequently can be achieved via OpenFlow\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : flow-restore-wait\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR starts up, it has an empty flow table
and therefore it handles all arriving packets in its default fashion
according to its configuration, by dropping them or sending them to
an OpenFlow controller or switching them as a standalone switch\[char46]
This behavior is ordinarily desirable\[char46]  However, if
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is restarting as part of a ``hot-upgrade,\(cq\(cq
then this leads to a relatively long period during which packets are
mishandled\[char46]
.IP
This option allows for improvement\[char46]  When \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR
starts with this value set as \fBtrue\fR, it will neither
flush or expire previously set datapath flows nor will it send and
receive any packets to or from the datapath\[char46]  When this value is
later set to \fBfalse\fR, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will
start receiving packets from the datapath and re-setup the flows\[char46]
.IP
Thus, with this option, the procedure for a hot-upgrade of
\fBovs\-vswitchd\fR becomes roughly the following:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
Stop \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR\[char46]
.IP 2. .25in
Set \fBother_config:flow-restore-wait\fR
to \fBtrue\fR\[char46]
.IP 3. .25in
Start \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR\[char46]
.IP 4. .25in
Use \fBovs\-ofctl\fR (or some other program, such as an
OpenFlow controller) to restore the OpenFlow flow table
to the desired state\[char46]
.IP 5. .25in
Set \fBother_config:flow-restore-wait\fR
to \fBfalse\fR (or remove it entirely from the database)\[char46]
.RE
.IP
The \fBovs\-ctl\fR\(cqs ``restart\(cq\(cq and ``force-reload-kmod\(cq\(cq
functions use the above config option during hot upgrades\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : flow-limit\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
The maximum
number of flows allowed in the datapath flow table\[char46]  Internally OVS
will choose a flow limit which will likely be lower than this number,
based on real time network conditions\[char46] Tweaking this value is
discouraged unless you know exactly what you\(cqre doing\[char46]
.IP
The default is 200000\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : max-idle\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 500"
The maximum time (in ms) that idle flows will remain cached in the
datapath\[char46] Internally OVS will check the validity and activity for
datapath flows regularly and may expire flows quicker than this
number, based on real time network conditions\[char46] Tweaking this
value is discouraged unless you know exactly what you\(cqre doing\[char46]
.IP
The default is 10000\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : n-dpdk-rxqs\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
Specifies the maximum number of rx queues to be created for each dpdk
interface\[char46]  If not specified or specified to 0, one rx queue will
be created for each dpdk interface by default\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : pmd-cpu-mask\fR: optional string"
Specifies CPU mask for setting the cpu affinity of PMD (Poll
Mode Driver) threads\[char46]  Value should be in the form of hex string,
similar to the dpdk EAL \(cq-c COREMASK\(cq option input or the \(cqtaskset\(cq
mask input\[char46]
.IP
The lowest order bit corresponds to the first CPU core\[char46]  A set bit
means the corresponding core is available and a pmd thread will be
created and pinned to it\[char46]  If the input does not cover all cores,
those uncovered cores are considered not set\[char46]
.IP
If not specified, one pmd thread will be created for each numa node
and pinned to any available core on the numa node by default\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : n-handler-threads\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
Specifies the number of threads for software datapaths to use for
handling new flows\[char46]  The default the number of online CPU cores minus
the number of revalidators\[char46]
.IP
This configuration is per datapath\[char46]  If you have more than one
software datapath (e\[char46]g\[char46] some \fBsystem\fR bridges and some
\fBnetdev\fR bridges), then the total number of threads is
\fBn\-handler\-threads\fR times the number of software
datapaths\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : n-revalidator-threads\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
Specifies the number of threads for software datapaths to use for
revalidating flows in the datapath\[char46]  Typically, there is a direct
correlation between the number of revalidator threads, and the number
of flows allowed in the datapath\[char46]  The default is the number of cpu
cores divided by four plus one\[char46]  If \fBn\-handler\-threads\fR is
set, the default changes to the number of cpu cores minus the number
of handler threads\[char46]
.IP
This configuration is per datapath\[char46]  If you have more than one
software datapath (e\[char46]g\[char46] some \fBsystem\fR bridges and some

this sequence number\[char46]
.IP "\fBcur_cfg\fR: integer"
Sequence number that Open vSwitch sets to the current value of
\fBnext_cfg\fR after it finishes applying a set of
configuration changes\[char46]
.ST "Statistics:"
The \fBstatistics\fR column contains key-value pairs that
report statistics about a system running an Open vSwitch\[char46]  These are
updated periodically (currently, every 5 seconds)\[char46]  Key-value pairs
that cannot be determined or that do not apply to a platform are
omitted\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : enable-statistics\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Statistics are disabled by default to avoid overhead in the common
case when statistics gathering is not useful\[char46]  Set this value to
\fBtrue\fR to enable populating the \fBstatistics\fR
column or to \fBfalse\fR to explicitly disable it\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatistics : cpu\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
Number of CPU processors, threads, or cores currently online and
available to the operating system on which Open vSwitch is running,
as an integer\[char46]  This may be less than the number installed, if some

Open vSwitch userspace processes are not multithreaded, but the
Linux kernel-based datapath is\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatistics : load_average\fR: optional string"
A comma-separated list of three floating-point numbers,
representing the system load average over the last 1, 5, and 15
minutes, respectively\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatistics : memory\fR: optional string"
A comma-separated list of integers, each of which represents a
quantity of memory in kilobytes that describes the operating
system on which Open vSwitch is running\[char46]  In respective order,
these values are:

One such key-value pair, with \fBNAME\fR replaced by
a process name, will exist for each running Open vSwitch
daemon process, with \fIname\fR replaced by the

and durations in milliseconds:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
The process\(cqs virtual memory size\[char46]
.IP 2. .25in
The process\(cqs resident set size\[char46]
.IP 3. .25in
The amount of user and system CPU time consumed by the
process\[char46]
.IP 4. .25in
The number of times that the process has crashed and been
automatically restarted by the monitor\[char46]
.IP 5. .25in
The duration since the process was started\[char46]
.IP 6. .25in
The duration for which the process has been running\[char46]
.RE
.IP
The interpretation of some of these values depends on whether the
process was started with the \fB\-\-monitor\fR\[char46]  If it
was not, then the crash count will always be 0 and the two
durations will always be the same\[char46]  If \fB\-\-monitor\fR
was given, then the crash count may be positive; if it is, the
latter duration is the amount of time since the most recent crash
and restart\[char46]
.IP
There will be one key-value pair for each file in Open vSwitch\(cqs
``run directory\(cq\(cq (usually \fB/var/run/openvswitch\fR)
whose name ends in \fB\[char46]pid\fR, whose contents are a
process ID, and which is locked by a running process\[char46]  The
\fIname\fR is taken from the pidfile\(cqs name\[char46]
.IP
Currently Open vSwitch is only able to obtain all of the above
detail on Linux systems\[char46]  On other systems, the same key-value
pairs will be present but the values will always be the empty
string\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatistics : file_systems\fR: optional string"
A space-separated list of information on local, writable file
systems\[char46]  Each item in the list describes one file system and
consists in turn of a comma-separated list of the following:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
Mount point, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fB/\fR or \fB/var/log\fR\[char46]
Any spaces or commas in the mount point are replaced by
underscores\[char46]
.IP 2. .25in
Total size, in kilobytes, as an integer\[char46]
.IP 3. .25in
Amount of storage in use, in kilobytes, as an integer\[char46]
.RE
.IP
This key-value pair is omitted if there are no local, writable
file systems or if Open vSwitch cannot obtain the needed
information\[char46]
.ST "Version Reporting:"
These columns report the types and versions of the hardware and
software running Open vSwitch\[char46]  We recommend in general that software
should test whether specific features are supported instead of relying
on version number checks\[char46]  These values are primarily intended for
reporting to human administrators\[char46]

a non-backward compatible way (e\[char46]g\[char46] deleting a column or a table),
\fImajor\fR is incremented\[char46]  When the database schema is changed
in a backward compatible way (e\[char46]g\[char46] adding a new column),
\fIminor\fR is incremented\[char46]  When the database schema is changed
cosmetically (e\[char46]g\[char46] reindenting its syntax), \fItweak\fR is

The schema version is part of the database schema, so it can also be
retrieved by fetching the schema using the Open vSwitch database

\fBstandalone\fR
If no message is received from the controller for three
times the inactivity probe interval
(see \fBinactivity_probe\fR), then Open vSwitch

.ST "VLAN Configuration:"
Bridge ports support the following types of VLAN configuration:
.RS
.TP
trunk
A trunk port carries packets on one or more specified VLANs
specified in the \fBtrunks\fR column (often, on every
VLAN)\[char46]  A packet that ingresses on a trunk port is in the VLAN
specified in its 802\[char46]1Q header, or VLAN 0 if the packet has no
802\[char46]1Q header\[char46]  A packet that egresses through a trunk port will
have an 802\[char46]1Q header if it has a nonzero VLAN ID\[char46]
.IP
Any packet that ingresses on a trunk port tagged with a VLAN that
the port does not trunk is dropped\[char46]
.TP
access
An access port carries packets on exactly one VLAN specified in the
\fBtag\fR column\[char46]  Packets egressing on an access port
have no 802\[char46]1Q header\[char46]
.IP
Any packet with an 802\[char46]1Q header with a nonzero VLAN ID that
ingresses on an access port is dropped, regardless of whether the
VLAN ID in the header is the access port\(cqs VLAN ID\[char46]
.TP
native-tagged
A native-tagged port resembles a trunk port, with the exception that
a packet without an 802\[char46]1Q header that ingresses on a native-tagged
port is in the ``native VLAN\(cq\(cq (specified in the \fBtag\fR
column)\[char46]
.TP
native-untagged
A native-untagged port resembles a native-tagged port, with the
exception that a packet that egresses on a native-untagged port in
the native VLAN will not have an 802\[char46]1Q header\[char46]
.RE
.PP
A packet will only egress through bridge ports that carry the VLAN of
the packet, as described by the rules above\[char46]
.IP "\fBvlan_mode\fR: optional string, one of \fBaccess\fR, \fBnative\-tagged\fR, \fBnative\-untagged\fR, or \fBtrunk\fR"
The VLAN mode of the port, as described above\[char46]  When this column is
empty, a default mode is selected as follows:
.RS
.IP \(bu
If \fBtag\fR contains a value, the port is an access
port\[char46]  The \fBtrunks\fR column should be empty\[char46]
.IP \(bu
Otherwise, the port is a trunk port\[char46]  The \fBtrunks\fR
column value is honored if it is present\[char46]
.RE
.IP "\fBtag\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095"
For an access port, the port\(cqs implicitly tagged VLAN\[char46]  For a
native-tagged or native-untagged port, the port\(cqs native VLAN\[char46]  Must
be empty if this is a trunk port\[char46]
.IP "\fBtrunks\fR: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095"
For a trunk, native-tagged, or native-untagged port, the 802\[char46]1Q VLAN
or VLANs that this port trunks; if it is empty, then the port trunks
all VLANs\[char46]  Must be empty if this is an access port\[char46]
.IP
A native-tagged or native-untagged port always trunks its native
VLAN, regardless of whether \fBtrunks\fR includes that
VLAN\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : priority-tags\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
An 802\[char46]1Q header contains two important pieces of information: a VLAN
ID and a priority\[char46]  A frame with a zero VLAN ID, called a
``priority-tagged\(cq\(cq frame, is supposed to be treated the same way as
a frame without an 802\[char46]1Q header at all (except for the priority)\[char46]
.IP
However, some network elements ignore any frame that has 802\[char46]1Q
header at all, even when the VLAN ID is zero\[char46]  Therefore, by default
Open vSwitch does not output priority-tagged frames, instead omitting
the 802\[char46]1Q header entirely if the VLAN ID is zero\[char46]  Set this key to
\fBtrue\fR to enable priority-tagged frames on a port\[char46]
.IP
Regardless of this setting, Open vSwitch omits the 802\[char46]1Q header on
output if both the VLAN ID and priority would be zero\[char46]
.IP
All frames output to native-tagged ports have a nonzero VLAN ID, so
this setting is not meaningful on native-tagged ports\[char46]
.ST "Bonding Configuration:"
A port that has more than one interface is a ``bonded port\[char46]\(cq\(cq Bonding
allows for load balancing and fail-over\[char46]
.PP
The following types of bonding will work with any kind of upstream
switch\[char46]  On the upstream switch, do not configure the interfaces as a
bond:
.RS
.TP
\fBbalance\-slb\fR
Balances flows among slaves based on source MAC address and output
VLAN, with periodic rebalancing as traffic patterns change\[char46]
.TP
\fBactive\-backup\fR
Assigns all flows to one slave, failing over to a backup slave when
the active slave is disabled\[char46]  This is the only bonding mode in which
interfaces may be plugged into different upstream switches\[char46]
.RE
.PP
The following modes require the upstream switch to support 802\[char46]3ad with
successful LACP negotiation\[char46] If LACP negotiation fails and
other-config:lacp-fallback-ab is true, then \fBactive\-backup\fR
mode is used:
.RS
.TP
\fBbalance\-tcp\fR
Balances flows among slaves based on L3 and L4 protocol information
such as IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports\[char46]
.RE
.PP
These columns apply only to bonded ports\[char46]  Their values are
otherwise ignored\[char46]
.IP "\fBbond_mode\fR: optional string, one of \fBactive\-backup\fR, \fBbalance\-tcp\fR, or \fBbalance\-slb\fR"
The type of bonding used for a bonded port\[char46]  Defaults to
\fBactive\-backup\fR if unset\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : bond-hash-basis\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
An integer hashed along with flows when choosing output slaves in load
balanced bonds\[char46]  When changed, all flows will be assigned different
hash values possibly causing slave selection decisions to change\[char46]  Does
not affect bonding modes which do not employ load balancing such as
\fBactive\-backup\fR\[char46]
.ST "Link Failure Detection:"
An important part of link bonding is detecting that links are down so
that they may be disabled\[char46]  These settings determine how Open vSwitch
detects link failure\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : bond-detect-mode\fR: optional string, either \fBmiimon\fR or \fBcarrier\fR"
The means used to detect link failures\[char46]  Defaults to
\fBcarrier\fR which uses each interface\(cqs carrier to detect
failures\[char46]  When set to \fBmiimon\fR, will check for failures
by polling each interface\(cqs MII\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : bond-miimon-interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
The interval, in milliseconds, between successive attempts to poll
each interface\(cqs MII\[char46]  Relevant only when \fBother_config:bond-detect-mode\fR is \fBmiimon\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBbond_updelay\fR: integer"
The number of milliseconds for which the link must stay up on an
interface before the interface is considered to be up\[char46]  Specify
\fB0\fR to enable the interface immediately\[char46]
.IP
This setting is honored only when at least one bonded interface is
already enabled\[char46]  When no interfaces are enabled, then the first
bond interface to come up is enabled immediately\[char46]
.IP "\fBbond_downdelay\fR: integer"
The number of milliseconds for which the link must stay down on an
interface before the interface is considered to be down\[char46]  Specify
\fB0\fR to disable the interface immediately\[char46]
.ST "LACP Configuration:"
LACP, the Link Aggregation Control Protocol, is an IEEE standard that
allows switches to automatically detect that they are connected by
multiple links and aggregate across those links\[char46]  These settings
control LACP behavior\[char46]
.IP "\fBlacp\fR: optional string, one of \fBactive\fR, \fBpassive\fR, or \fBoff\fR"
Configures LACP on this port\[char46]  LACP allows directly connected
switches to negotiate which links may be bonded\[char46]  LACP may be enabled
on non-bonded ports for the benefit of any switches they may be
connected to\[char46]  \fBactive\fR ports are allowed to initiate LACP
negotiations\[char46]  \fBpassive\fR ports are allowed to participate
in LACP negotiations initiated by a remote switch, but not allowed to
initiate such negotiations themselves\[char46]  If LACP is enabled on a port
whose partner switch does not support LACP, the bond will be
disabled, unless other-config:lacp-fallback-ab is set to true\[char46]
Defaults to \fBoff\fR if unset\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : lacp-system-id\fR: optional string"
The LACP system ID of this \fBPort\fR\[char46]  The system ID of a
LACP bond is used to identify itself to its partners\[char46]  Must be a
nonzero MAC address\[char46] Defaults to the bridge Ethernet address if
unset\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : lacp-system-priority\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 1 to 65,535"
The LACP system priority of this \fBPort\fR\[char46]  In LACP
negotiations, link status decisions are made by the system with the
numerically lower priority\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : lacp-time\fR: optional string, either \fBslow\fR or \fBfast\fR"
The LACP timing which should be used on this \fBPort\fR\[char46]
By default \fBslow\fR is used\[char46]  When configured to be
\fBfast\fR LACP heartbeats are requested at a rate of once
per second causing connectivity problems to be detected more
quickly\[char46]  In \fBslow\fR mode, heartbeats are requested at a
rate of once every 30 seconds\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : lacp-fallback-ab\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Determines the behavior of openvswitch bond in LACP mode\[char46] If
the partner switch does not support LACP, setting this option
to \fBtrue\fR allows openvswitch to fallback to
active-backup\[char46] If the option is set to \fBfalse\fR, the
bond will be disabled\[char46] In both the cases, once the partner switch
is configured to LACP mode, the bond will use LACP\[char46]
.ST "Rebalancing Configuration:"
These settings control behavior when a bond is in
\fBbalance\-slb\fR or \fBbalance\-tcp\fR mode\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : bond-rebalance-interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 0 to 10,000"
For a load balanced bonded port, the number of milliseconds between
successive attempts to rebalance the bond, that is, to move flows
from one interface on the bond to another in an attempt to keep usage
of each interface roughly equal\[char46]  If zero, load balancing is disabled
on the bond (link failure still cause flows to move)\[char46]  If
less than 1000ms, the rebalance interval will be 1000ms\[char46]
.IP "\fBbond_fake_iface\fR: boolean"
For a bonded port, whether to create a fake internal interface with the
name of the port\[char46]  Use only for compatibility with legacy software that
requires this\[char46]
.ST "Spanning Tree Protocol:"

.IP "\fBother_config : stp-path-cost\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 0 to 65,535"
Spanning tree path cost for the port\[char46]  A lower number indicates
a faster link\[char46]  By default, the cost is based on the maximum

A positive interface index as defined for SNMP MIB-II in RFCs 1213 and

For the local interface, the default is the lowest-numbered MAC

whose name is first in alphabetical order)\[char46]  Internal ports and

.ST "OpenFlow Port Number:"
When a client adds a new interface, Open vSwitch chooses an OpenFlow
port number for the new port\[char46]  If the client that adds the port fills
in \fBofport_request\fR, then Open vSwitch tries to use its
value as the OpenFlow port number\[char46]  Otherwise, or if the requested
port number is already in use or cannot be used for another reason,
Open vSwitch automatically assigns a free port number\[char46]  Regardless of
how the port number was obtained, Open vSwitch then reports in \fBofport\fR the port number actually assigned\[char46]
.PP
Open vSwitch limits the port numbers that it automatically assigns to

free use of ports 32,768 and up\[char46]

Requested OpenFlow port number for this interface\[char46]

A client should ideally set this column\(cqs value in the same
database transaction that it uses to create the interface\[char46]  Open
vSwitch version 2\[char46]1 and later will honor a later request for a
specific port number, althuogh it might confuse some controllers:
OpenFlow does not have a way to announce a port number change, so
Open vSwitch represents it over OpenFlow as a port deletion
followed immediately by a port addition\[char46]

If \fBofport_request\fR is set or changed to some other

\fBvxlan\fR
An Ethernet tunnel over the UDP-based VXLAN protocol described in
RFC 7348\[char46]

Open vSwitch uses UDP destination port 4789\[char46]  The source port used for
VXLAN traffic varies on a per-flow basis and is in the ephemeral port

\fBlisp\fR
A layer 3 tunnel over the experimental, UDP-based Locator/ID
Separation Protocol (RFC 6830)\[char46]
.IP
Only IPv4 and IPv6 packets are supported by the protocol, and
they are sent and received without an Ethernet header\[char46]  Traffic
to/from LISP ports is expected to be configured explicitly, and
the ports are not intended to participate in learning based
switching\[char46]  As such, they are always excluded from packet
flooding\[char46]
.TP
\fBstt\fR
The Stateless TCP Tunnel (STT) is particularly useful when tunnel
endpoints are in end-systems, as it utilizes the capabilities of
standard network interface cards to improve performance\[char46]  STT utilizes
a TCP-like header inside the IP header\[char46] It is stateless, i\[char46]e\[char46], there is
no TCP connection state of any kind associated with the tunnel\[char46]  The
TCP-like header is used to leverage the capabilities of existing
network interface cards, but should not be interpreted as implying
any sort of connection state between endpoints\[char46]
Since the STT protocol does not engage in the usual TCP 3-way handshake,
so it will have difficulty traversing stateful firewalls\[char46]
The protocol is documented at
http://www\[char46]ietf\[char46]org/archive/id/draft-davie-stt\-06\[char46]txt
All traffic uses a default destination port of 7471\[char46] STT is only

These settings control ingress policing for packets received on this
interface\[char46]  On a physical interface, this limits the rate at which
traffic is allowed into the system from the outside; on a virtual
interface (one connected to a virtual machine), this limits the rate at
which the VM is able to transmit\[char46]
.PP
Policing is a simple form of quality-of-service that simply drops
packets received in excess of the configured rate\[char46]  Due to its
simplicity, policing is usually less accurate and less effective than
egress QoS (which is configured using the \fBQoS\fR and \fBQueue\fR tables)\[char46]
.PP
Policing is currently implemented only on Linux\[char46]  The Linux
implementation uses a simple ``token bucket\(cq\(cq approach:
.RS
.IP \(bu
The size of the bucket corresponds to \fBingress_policing_burst\fR\[char46]  Initially the bucket is full\[char46]
.IP \(bu
Whenever a packet is received, its size (converted to tokens) is
compared to the number of tokens currently in the bucket\[char46]  If the
required number of tokens are available, they are removed and the
packet is forwarded\[char46]  Otherwise, the packet is dropped\[char46]
.IP \(bu
Whenever it is not full, the bucket is refilled with tokens at the
rate specified by \fBingress_policing_rate\fR\[char46]
.RE
.PP
Policing interacts badly with some network protocols, and especially
with fragmented IP packets\[char46]  Suppose that there is enough network
activity to keep the bucket nearly empty all the time\[char46]  Then this token
bucket algorithm will forward a single packet every so often, with the
period depending on packet size and on the configured rate\[char46]  All of the
fragments of an IP packets are normally transmitted back-to-back, as a
group\[char46]  In such a situation, therefore, only one of these fragments
will be forwarded and the rest will be dropped\[char46]  IP does not provide
any way for the intended recipient to ask for only the remaining
fragments\[char46]  In such a case there are two likely possibilities for what
will happen next: either all of the fragments will eventually be
retransmitted (as TCP will do), in which case the same problem will
recur, or the sender will not realize that its packet has been dropped
and data will simply be lost (as some UDP-based protocols will do)\[char46]
Either way, it is possible that no forward progress will ever occur\[char46]
.IP "\fBingress_policing_rate\fR: integer, at least 0"
Maximum rate for data received on this interface, in kbps\[char46]  Data
received faster than this rate is dropped\[char46]  Set to \fB0\fR
(the default) to disable policing\[char46]
.IP "\fBingress_policing_burst\fR: integer, at least 0"
Maximum burst size for data received on this interface, in kb\[char46]  The
default burst size if set to \fB0\fR is 8000 kbit\[char46]  This value
has no effect if \fBingress_policing_rate\fR
is \fB0\fR\[char46]
.IP
Specifying a larger burst size lets the algorithm be more forgiving,
which is important for protocols like TCP that react severely to
dropped packets\[char46]  The burst size should be at least the size of the
interface\(cqs MTU\[char46]  Specifying a value that is numerically at least as
large as 80% of \fBingress_policing_rate\fR helps TCP come
closer to achieving the full rate\[char46]
.ST "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD):"
BFD, defined in RFC 5880 and RFC 5881, allows point-to-point
detection of connectivity failures by occasional transmission of
BFD control messages\[char46]  Open vSwitch implements BFD to serve
as a more popular and standards compliant alternative to CFM\[char46]
.PP
BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a rate
negotiated independently in each direction\[char46]  Each endpoint specifies
the rate at which it expects to receive control messages, and the rate
at which it is willing to transmit them\[char46]  Open vSwitch uses a detection
multiplier of three, meaning that an endpoint signals a connectivity
fault if three consecutive BFD control messages fail to arrive\[char46]  In the
case of a unidirectional connectivity issue, the system not receiving
BFD control messages signals the problem to its peer in the messages it
transmits\[char46]

.IP "\fBcfm_health\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 100"
Indicates the health of the interface as a percentage of CCM frames
received over 21 \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fRs\[char46]
The health of an interface is undefined if it is communicating with
more than one \fBcfm_remote_mpids\fR\[char46]  It reduces if
healthy heartbeats are not received at the expected rate, and
gradually improves as healthy heartbeats are received at the desired
rate\[char46] Every 21 \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fRs, the
health of the interface is refreshed\[char46]
.IP
As mentioned above, the faults can be triggered for several reasons\[char46]
The link health will deteriorate even if heartbeats are received but
they are reported to be unhealthy\[char46]  An unhealthy heartbeat in this
context is a heartbeat for which either some fault is set or is out
of sequence\[char46]  The interface health can be 100 only on receiving
healthy heartbeats at the desired rate\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_remote_mpids\fR: set of integers"
When CFM is properly configured, Open vSwitch will occasionally
receive CCM broadcasts\[char46]  These broadcasts contain the MPID of the

\fBInterface\fR is receiving broadcasts from is regularly
collected and written to this column\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
The interval, in milliseconds, between transmissions of CFM
heartbeats\[char46]  Three missed heartbeat receptions indicate a

.IP
In standard operation only intervals of 3, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000,
60,000, or 600,000 ms are supported\[char46]  Other values will be rounded

We do not recommend using intervals less than 100 ms\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_extended\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBtrue\fR, the CFM module operates in extended mode\[char46] This
causes it to use a nonstandard destination address to avoid conflicting
with compliant implementations which may be running concurrently on the
network\[char46] Furthermore, extended mode increases the accuracy of the
\fBcfm_interval\fR configuration parameter by breaking wire
compatibility with 802\[char46]1ag compliant implementations\[char46]  And extended

.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_demand\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBtrue\fR, and
\fBother_config:cfm_extended\fR is true, the CFM
module operates in demand mode\[char46]  When in demand mode, traffic
received on the \fBInterface\fR is used to indicate
liveness\[char46]  CCMs are still transmitted and received\[char46]  At least one
CCM must be received every 100 * \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fR amount of time\[char46]  Otherwise, even if traffic
are received, the CFM module will raise the connectivity fault\[char46]
.IP
Demand mode has a couple of caveats:
.RS
.IP \(bu
To ensure that ovs-vswitchd has enough time to pull statistics
from the datapath, the fault detection interval is set to
3\[char46]5 * MAX(\fBother_config:cfm_interval\fR, 500)
ms\[char46]
.IP \(bu
To avoid ambiguity, demand mode disables itself when there are
multiple remote maintenance points\[char46]
.IP \(bu
If the \fBInterface\fR is heavily congested, CCMs
containing the \fBother_config:cfm_opstate\fR
status may be dropped causing changes in the operational state to
be delayed\[char46]  Similarly, if CCMs containing the RDI bit are not
received, unidirectional link failures may not be detected\[char46]
.RE
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_opstate\fR: optional string, either \fBdown\fR or \fBup\fR"
When \fBdown\fR, the CFM module marks all CCMs it generates as
operationally down without triggering a fault\[char46]  This allows remote
maintenance points to choose not to forward traffic to the
\fBInterface\fR on which this CFM module is running\[char46]
Currently, in Open vSwitch, the opdown bit of CCMs affects
\fBInterface\fRs participating in bonds, and the bundle

.IP "\fBprefixes\fR: set of up to 3 strings"
This string set specifies which fields should be used for
address prefix tracking\[char46]  Prefix tracking allows the
classifier to skip rules with longer than necessary prefixes,
resulting in better wildcarding for datapath flows\[char46]
.IP
Prefix tracking may be beneficial when a flow table contains
matches on IP address fields with different prefix lengths\[char46]
For example, when a flow table contains IP address matches on
both full addresses and proper prefixes, the full address
matches will typically cause the datapath flow to un-wildcard
the whole address field (depending on flow entry priorities)\[char46]
In this case each packet with a different address gets handed
to the userspace for flow processing and generates its own
datapath flow\[char46]  With prefix tracking enabled for the address
field in question packets with addresses matching shorter
prefixes would generate datapath flows where the irrelevant
address bits are wildcarded, allowing the same datapath flow
to handle all the packets within the prefix in question\[char46]  In
this case many userspace upcalls can be avoided and the
overall performance can be better\[char46]
.IP
This is a performance optimization only, so packets will
receive the same treatment with or without prefix tracking\[char46]

By default, the \fBprefixes=ip_dst,ip_src\fR are used
on each flow table\[char46]  This instructs the flow classifier to
track the IP destination and source addresses used by the

.SH "Mirror TABLE"
A port mirror within a \fBBridge\fR\[char46]
.PP
A port mirror configures a bridge to send selected frames to special
``mirrored\(cq\(cq ports, in addition to their normal destinations\[char46]  Mirroring
traffic may also be referred to as SPAN or RSPAN, depending on how
the mirrored traffic is sent\[char46]
.PP
When a packet enters an Open vSwitch bridge, it becomes eligible for
mirroring based on its ingress port and VLAN\[char46]  As the packet travels
through the flow tables, each time it is output to a port, it becomes
eligible for mirroring based on the egress port and VLAN\[char46]  In Open
vSwitch 2\[char46]5 and later, mirroring occurs just after a packet first becomes
eligible, using the packet as it exists at that point; in Open vSwitch
2\[char46]4 and earlier, mirroring occurs only after a packet has traversed all
the flow tables, using the original packet as it entered the bridge\[char46]
This makes a difference only when the flow table modifies the packet: in
Open vSwitch 2\[char46]4, the modifications are never visible to mirrors, whereas
in Open vSwitch 2\[char46]5 and later modifications made before the first output
that makes it eligible for mirroring to a particular destination are
visible\[char46]
.PP
A packet that enters an Open vSwitch bridge is mirrored to a particular
destination only once, even if it is eligible for multiple reasons\[char46]  For
example, a packet would be mirrored to a particular \fBoutput_port\fR only once, even if it is selected for mirroring to
that port by \fBselect_dst_port\fR and \fBselect_src_port\fR in the same or different \fBMirror\fR

.IP
See the documentation for
\fBother_config:forward-bpdu\fR in the
\fBInterface\fR table for a list of destination MAC
addresses which will not be mirrored to a VLAN to avoid confusing
switches that interpret the protocols that they represent\[char46]
.IP
\fBPlease note:\fR Mirroring to a VLAN can disrupt a network that
contains unmanaged switches\[char46]  Consider an unmanaged physical switch
with two ports: port 1, connected to an end host, and port 2,
connected to an Open vSwitch configured to mirror received packets
into VLAN 123 on port 2\[char46]  Suppose that the end host sends a packet on
port 1 that the physical switch forwards to port 2\[char46]  The Open vSwitch
forwards this packet to its destination and then reflects it back on
port 2 in VLAN 123\[char46]  This reflected packet causes the unmanaged
physical switch to replace the MAC learning table entry, which
correctly pointed to port 1, with one that incorrectly points to port
2\[char46]  Afterward, the physical switch will direct packets destined for
the end host to the Open vSwitch on port 2, instead of to the end
host on port 1, disrupting connectivity\[char46]  If mirroring to a VLAN is
desired in this scenario, then the physical switch must be replaced
by one that learns Ethernet addresses on a per-VLAN basis\[char46]  In
addition, learning should be disabled on the VLAN containing mirrored
traffic\[char46] If this is not done then intermediate switches will learn
the MAC address of each end host from the mirrored traffic\[char46]  If
packets being sent to that end host are also mirrored, then they will
be dropped since the switch will attempt to send them out the input
port\[char46] Disabling learning for the VLAN will cause the switch to
correctly send the packet out all ports configured for that VLAN\[char46]  If
Open vSwitch is being used as an intermediate switch, learning can be
disabled by adding the mirrored VLAN to \fBflood_vlans\fR
in the appropriate \fBBridge\fR table or tables\[char46]

.SH "Controller TABLE"
An OpenFlow controller\[char46]
.PP
Open vSwitch supports two kinds of OpenFlow controllers:
.RS
.TP
Primary controllers
This is the kind of controller envisioned by the OpenFlow 1\[char46]0
specification\[char46]  Usually, a primary controller implements a network
policy by taking charge of the switch\(cqs flow table\[char46]
.IP
Open vSwitch initiates and maintains persistent connections to
primary controllers, retrying the connection each time it fails or
drops\[char46]  The \fBfail_mode\fR column in the
\fBBridge\fR table applies to primary controllers\[char46]
.IP
Open vSwitch permits a bridge to have any number of primary
controllers\[char46]  When multiple controllers are configured, Open
vSwitch connects to all of them simultaneously\[char46]  Because
OpenFlow 1\[char46]0 does not specify how multiple controllers
coordinate in interacting with a single switch, more than
one primary controller should be specified only if the
controllers are themselves designed to coordinate with each
other\[char46]  (The Nicira-defined \fBNXT_ROLE\fR OpenFlow
vendor extension may be useful for this\[char46])
.TP
Service controllers
These kinds of OpenFlow controller connections are intended for
occasional support and maintenance use, e\[char46]g\[char46] with
\fBovs\-ofctl\fR\[char46]  Usually a service controller connects only
briefly to inspect or modify some of a switch\(cqs state\[char46]
.IP
Open vSwitch listens for incoming connections from service
controllers\[char46]  The service controllers initiate and, if necessary,
maintain the connections from their end\[char46]  The \fBfail_mode\fR column in the \fBBridge\fR table does
not apply to service controllers\[char46]

strings that describes how Open vSwitch contacts this OpenFlow
controller over the network:
.RS
.TP
\fBin\-band\fR
In this mode, this controller\(cqs OpenFlow traffic travels over the
bridge associated with the controller\[char46]  With this setting, Open
vSwitch allows traffic to and from the controller regardless of the
contents of the OpenFlow flow table\[char46]  (Otherwise, Open vSwitch
would never be able to connect to the controller, because it did
not have a flow to enable it\[char46])  This is the most common connection
mode because it is not necessary to maintain two independent
networks\[char46]
.TP
\fBout\-of\-band\fR
In this mode, OpenFlow traffic uses a control network separate
from the bridge associated with this controller, that is, the
bridge does not use any of its own network devices to communicate
with the controller\[char46]  The control network must be configured
separately, before or after \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is started\[char46]
.RE
.IP

Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to
controller before sending an inactivity probe message\[char46]  If Open
vSwitch does not communicate with the controller for the specified

received for the same additional amount of time, Open vSwitch
assumes the connection has been broken and attempts to reconnect\[char46]
Default is implementation-specific\[char46]  A value of 0 disables
inactivity probes\[char46]
.ST "Asynchronous Messages:"
OpenFlow switches send certain messages to controllers spontanenously,
that is, not in response to any request from the controller\[char46]  These
messages are called ``asynchronous messages\[char46]\(cq\(cq  These columns allow
asynchronous messages to be limited or disabled to ensure the best use
of network resources\[char46]
.IP "\fBenable_async_messages\fR: optional boolean"
The OpenFlow protocol enables asynchronous messages at time of
connection establishment, which means that a controller can receive
asynchronous messages, potentially many of them, even if it turns them
off immediately after connecting\[char46]  Set this column to
\fBfalse\fR to change Open vSwitch behavior to disable, by
default, all asynchronous messages\[char46]  The controller can use the
\fBNXT_SET_ASYNC_CONFIG\fR Nicira extension to OpenFlow to turn
on any messages that it does want to receive, if any\[char46]
.ST "Controller Rate Limiting:"
A switch can forward packets to a controller over the OpenFlow
protocol\[char46]  Forwarding packets this way at too high a rate can
overwhelm a controller, frustrate use of the OpenFlow connection for
other purposes, increase the latency of flow setup, and use an
unreasonable amount of bandwidth\[char46]  Therefore, Open vSwitch supports
limiting the rate of packet forwarding to a controller\[char46]
.PP
There are two main reasons in OpenFlow for a packet to be sent to a
controller: either the packet ``misses\(cq\(cq in the flow table, that is,
there is no matching flow, or a flow table action says to send the
packet to the controller\[char46]  Open vSwitch limits the rate of each kind
of packet separately at the configured rate\[char46]  Therefore, the actual
rate that packets are sent to the controller can be up to twice the
configured rate, when packets are sent for both reasons\[char46]
.PP
This feature is specific to forwarding packets over an OpenFlow
connection\[char46]  It is not general-purpose QoS\[char46]  See the \fBQoS\fR table for quality of service configuration, and \fBingress_policing_rate\fR in the \fBInterface\fR table for ingress policing configuration\[char46]
.IP "\fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR: optional integer, at least 100"
The maximum rate at which the switch will forward packets to the
OpenFlow controller, in packets per second\[char46]  If no value is
specified, rate limiting is disabled\[char46]
.IP "\fBcontroller_burst_limit\fR: optional integer, at least 25"
When a high rate triggers rate-limiting, Open vSwitch queues
packets to the controller for each port and transmits them to the
controller at the configured rate\[char46]  This value limits the number of
queued packets\[char46]  Ports on a bridge share the packet queue fairly\[char46]
.IP
This value has no effect unless \fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR is configured\[char46]  The current
default when this value is not specified is one-quarter of \fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR, meaning that queuing can delay
forwarding a packet to the controller by up to 250 ms\[char46]
.ST "Controller Rate Limiting Statistics:"
These values report the effects of rate limiting\[char46]  Their values are
relative to establishment of the most recent OpenFlow connection,
or since rate limiting was enabled, whichever happened more
recently\[char46]  Each consists of two values, one with \fBTYPE\fR
replaced by \fBmiss\fR for rate limiting flow table misses,
and the other with \fBTYPE\fR replaced by
\fBaction\fR for rate limiting packets sent by OpenFlow
actions\[char46]
.PP
These statistics are reported only when controller rate limiting is
enabled\[char46]

.SH "AutoAttach TABLE"
Auto Attach configuration within a bridge\[char46]  The IETF Auto-Attach SPBM
draft standard describes a compact method of using IEEE 802\[char46]1AB Link
Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) together with a IEEE 802\[char46]1aq Shortest
Path Bridging (SPB) network to automatically attach network devices
to individual services in a SPB network\[char46]  The intent here is to allow
network applications and devices using OVS to be able to easily take
advantage of features offered by industry standard SPB networks\[char46]
.PP
Auto Attach (AA) uses LLDP to communicate between a directly connected
Auto Attach Client (AAC) and Auto Attach Server (AAS)\[char46] The LLDP protocol
is extended to add two new Type-Length-Value tuples (TLVs)\[char46] The first
new TLV supports the ongoing discovery of directly connected AA
correspondents\[char46] Auto Attach operates by regularly transmitting AA
discovery TLVs between the AA client and AA server\[char46] By exchanging these
discovery messages, both the AAC and AAS learn the system name and
system description of their peer\[char46] In the OVS context, OVS operates as
the AA client and the AA server resides on a switch at the edge of the
SPB network\[char46]
.PP
Once AA discovery has been completed the AAC then uses the second new TLV
to deliver identifier mappings from the AAC to the AAS\[char46] A primary feature
of Auto Attach is to facilitate the mapping of VLANs defined outside the
SPB network onto service ids (ISIDs) defined within the SPM network\[char46] By
doing so individual external VLANs can be mapped onto specific SPB
network services\[char46] These VLAN id to ISID mappings can be configured and
managed locally using new options added to the ovs-vsctl command\[char46]
.PP
The Auto Attach OVS feature does not provide a full implementation of
the LLDP protocol\[char46] Support for the mandatory TLVs as defined by the LLDP
standard and support for the AA TLV extensions is provided\[char46] LLDP
protocol support in OVS can be enabled or disabled on a port by port
basis\[char46] LLDP support is disabled by default\[char46]
