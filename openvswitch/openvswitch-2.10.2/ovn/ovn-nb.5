ovn-nb \- OVN_Northbound database schema
.PP
.PP
.PP
.PP
This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it\[char46] The CMS produces almost all of the contents of the database\[char46] The \fBovn\-northd\fR program monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the \fBOVN_Southbound\fR database\[char46]
.PP
.PP
We generally speak of ``the\(cq\(cq CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment\[char46]
.SS "External IDs"

.PP
Each of the tables in this database contains a special column, named \fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46] This column has the same form and purpose each place it appears\[char46]

Key-value pairs for use by the CMS\[char46] The CMS might use certain pairs, for example, to identify entities in its own configuration that correspond to those in this database\[char46]

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

When a large number of containers are nested within a VM, it may be too expensive to dedicate a VIF to each container\[char46] OVN can use VLAN tags to support such cases\[char46] Each container is assigned a VLAN ID and each packet that passes between the hypervisor and the VM is tagged with the appropriate ID for the container\[char46] Such VLAN IDs never appear on a physical wire, even inside a tunnel, so they need not be unique except relative to a single VM on a hypervisor\[char46]

.IP
Each element in the set must take one of the following forms:
.RS
.TP
\fBEthernet address followed by zero or more IPv4 or IPv6 addresses (or both)\fR
An Ethernet address defined is owned by the logical port\[char46] Like a physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has a single fixed Ethernet address\[char46]
.IP
When a OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet frame whose destination MAC address is in a logical port\(cqs \fBaddresses\fR column, it delivers it only to that port, as if a MAC learning process had learned that MAC address on the port\[char46]
.IP
If IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) (or both) are defined, it indicates that the logical port owns the given IP addresses\[char46]
.IP
If IPv4 address(es) are defined, the OVN logical switch uses this information to synthesize responses to ARP requests without traversing the physical network\[char46] The OVN logical router connected to the logical switch, if any, uses this information to avoid issuing ARP requests for logical switch ports\[char46]
.IP
Note that the order here is important\[char46] The Ethernet address must be listed before the IP address(es) if defined\[char46]

\fBunknown\fR
This indicates that the logical port has an unknown set of Ethernet addresses\[char46] When an OVN logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet frame whose destination MAC address is not in any logical port\(cqs \fBaddresses\fR column, it delivers it to the port (or ports) whose \fBaddresses\fR columns include \fBunknown\fR\[char46]

\fBdynamic\fR

\fBEthernet address followed by keyword \(dqdynamic\(dq\fR
The keyword \fBdynamic\fR after the MAC address indicates that \fBovn\-northd\fR should choose an unused IPv4 address from the logical port\(cqs subnet and store it with the specified MAC in the port\(cqs \fBdynamic_addresses\fR column\[char46] \fBovn\-northd\fR will use the subnet specified in \fBother_config:subnet\fR in the port\(cqs \fBLogical_Switch\fR table\[char46]
.IP
Examples:

\fB80:fa:5b:06:72:b7 dynamic\fR

The resulting addresses are used to populate the logical switch\(cqs destination lookup, and also for the logical switch to generate ARP and ND replies\[char46]
