Description: OVN host components
 OVN, the Open Virtual Network, is a system to support virtual network
 abstraction.  OVN complements the existing capabilities of OVS to add
 native support for virtual network abstractions, such as virtual L2 and L3
 overlays and security groups.
 .
 ovn-host provides the userspace components and utilities for
 OVN that can be run on every host/hypervisor.
