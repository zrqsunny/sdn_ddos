ovs-vswitchd\[char46]conf\[char46]db \- Open_vSwitch database schema
.PP
.PP
.PP
.PP
A database with this schema holds the configuration for one Open vSwitch daemon\[char46] The top-level configuration for the daemon is the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table, which must have exactly one record\[char46] Records in other tables are significant only when they can be reached directly or indirectly from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table\[char46] Records that are not reachable from the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table are automatically deleted from the database, except for records in a few distinguished ``root set\(cq\(cq tables\[char46]
.SS "Common Columns"
.PP
.PP
Most tables contain two special columns, named \fBother_config\fR and \fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46] These columns have the same form and purpose each place that they appear, so we describe them here to save space later\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBother_config\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for configuring rarely used features\[char46] Supported keys, along with the forms taken by their values, are documented individually for each table\[char46]
.IP
A few tables do not have \fBother_config\fR columns because no key-value pairs have yet been defined for them\[char46]
.TP
\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that integrate with Open vSwitch, rather than by Open vSwitch itself\[char46] System integrators should either use the Open vSwitch development mailing list to coordinate on common key-value definitions, or choose key names that are likely to be unique\[char46] In some cases, where key-value pairs have been defined that are likely to be widely useful, they are documented individually for each table\[char46]

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

A unique identifier for the Open vSwitch\(cqs physical host\[char46] The form of the identifier depends on the type of the host\[char46] On a Citrix XenServer, this will likely be the same as \fBexternal_ids:xs-system-uuid\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBexternal_ids : xs-system-uuid\fR: optional string"
The Citrix XenServer universally unique identifier for the physical host as displayed by \fBxe host\-list\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBexternal_ids : hostname\fR: optional string"
The hostname for the host running Open vSwitch\[char46] This is a fully qualified domain name since version 2\[char46]6\[char46]2\[char46]
.IP "\fBexternal_ids : rundir\fR: optional string"
In Open vSwitch 2\[char46]8 and later, the run directory of the running Open vSwitch daemon\[char46] This directory is used for runtime state such as control and management sockets\[char46] The value of \fBother_config:vhost-sock-dir\fR is relative to this directory\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : stats-update-interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 5,000"
Interval for updating statistics to the database, in milliseconds\[char46] This option will affect the update of the \fBstatistics\fR column in the following tables: \fBPort\fR, \fBInterface
\fR, \fBMirror\fR\[char46]
.IP
Default value is 5000 ms\[char46]
.IP
Getting statistics more frequently can be achieved via OpenFlow\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : flow-restore-wait\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR starts up, it has an empty flow table and therefore it handles all arriving packets in its default fashion according to its configuration, by dropping them or sending them to an OpenFlow controller or switching them as a standalone switch\[char46] This behavior is ordinarily desirable\[char46] However, if \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is restarting as part of a ``hot-upgrade,\(cq\(cq then this leads to a relatively long period during which packets are mishandled\[char46]
.IP
This option allows for improvement\[char46] When \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR starts with this value set as \fBtrue\fR, it will neither flush or expire previously set datapath flows nor will it send and receive any packets to or from the datapath\[char46] When this value is later set to \fBfalse\fR, \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR will start receiving packets from the datapath and re-setup the flows\[char46]
.IP
Thus, with this option, the procedure for a hot-upgrade of \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR becomes roughly the following:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
Stop \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR\[char46]
.IP 2. .25in

.IP "\fBother_config : flow-limit\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
The maximum number of flows allowed in the datapath flow table\[char46] Internally OVS will choose a flow limit which will likely be lower than this number, based on real time network conditions\[char46] Tweaking this value is discouraged unless you know exactly what you\(cqre doing\[char46]
.IP
The default is 200000\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : max-idle\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 500"
The maximum time (in ms) that idle flows will remain cached in the datapath\[char46] Internally OVS will check the validity and activity for datapath flows regularly and may expire flows quicker than this number, based on real time network conditions\[char46] Tweaking this value is discouraged unless you know exactly what you\(cqre doing\[char46]

The default is 10000\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : hw-offload\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Set this value to \fBtrue\fR to enable netdev flow offload\[char46]

.IP
Currently Open vSwitch supports hardware offloading on Linux systems\[char46] On other systems, this value is ignored\[char46] This functionality is considered \(cqexperimental\(cq\[char46] Depending on which OpenFlow matches and actions are configured, which kernel version is used, and what hardware is available, Open vSwitch may not be able to offload functionality to hardware\[char46]

.IP "\fBother_config : dpdk-init\fR: optional string, one of \fBfalse\fR, \fBtrue\fR, or \fBtry\fR"
Set this value to \fBtrue\fR or \fBtry\fR to enable runtime support for DPDK ports\[char46] The vswitch must have compile-time support for DPDK as well\[char46]
.IP
A value of \fBtrue\fR will cause the ovs-vswitchd process to abort if DPDK cannot be initialized\[char46] A value of \fBtry\fR will allow the ovs-vswitchd process to continue running even if DPDK cannot be initialized\[char46]
.IP
The default value is \fBfalse\fR\[char46] Changing this value requires restarting the daemon
.IP
If this value is \fBfalse\fR at startup, any dpdk ports which are configured in the bridge will fail due to memory errors\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : dpdk-lcore-mask\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
Specifies the CPU cores where dpdk lcore threads should be spawned\[char46] The DPDK lcore threads are used for DPDK library tasks, such as library internal message processing, logging, etc\[char46] Value should be in the form of a hex string (so \(cq0x123\(cq) similar to the \(cqtaskset\(cq mask input\[char46]
.IP
The lowest order bit corresponds to the first CPU core\[char46] A set bit means the corresponding core is available and an lcore thread will be created and pinned to it\[char46] If the input does not cover all cores, those uncovered cores are considered not set\[char46]
.IP
For performance reasons, it is best to set this to a single core on the system, rather than allow lcore threads to float\[char46]
.IP
If not specified, the value will be determined by choosing the lowest CPU core from initial cpu affinity list\[char46] Otherwise, the value will be passed directly to the DPDK library\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : pmd-cpu-mask\fR: optional string"
Specifies CPU mask for setting the cpu affinity of PMD (Poll Mode Driver) threads\[char46] Value should be in the form of hex string, similar to the dpdk EAL \(cq-c COREMASK\(cq option input or the \(cqtaskset\(cq mask input\[char46]
.IP
The lowest order bit corresponds to the first CPU core\[char46] A set bit means the corresponding core is available and a pmd thread will be created and pinned to it\[char46] If the input does not cover all cores, those uncovered cores are considered not set\[char46]
.IP
If not specified, one pmd thread will be created for each numa node and pinned to any available core on the numa node by default\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : dpdk-alloc-mem\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
Specifies the amount of memory to preallocate from the hugepage pool, regardless of socket\[char46] It is recommended that dpdk-socket-mem is used instead\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : dpdk-socket-mem\fR: optional string"
Specifies the amount of memory to preallocate from the hugepage pool, on a per-socket basis\[char46]
.IP
The specifier is a comma-separated string, in ascending order of CPU socket\[char46] E\[char46]g\[char46] On a four socket system 1024,0,2048 would set socket 0 to preallocate 1024MB, socket 1 to preallocate 0MB, socket 2 to preallocate 2048MB and socket 3 (no value given) to preallocate 0MB\[char46]
.IP
If dpdk-socket-mem and dpdk-alloc-mem are not specified, dpdk-socket-mem will be used and the default value is 1024 for each numa node\[char46] If dpdk-socket-mem and dpdk-alloc-mem are specified at same time, dpdk-socket-mem will be used as default\[char46] Changing this value requires restarting the daemon\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : dpdk-hugepage-dir\fR: optional string"
Specifies the path to the hugetlbfs mount point\[char46]
.IP
If not specified, this will be guessed by the DPDK library (default is /dev/hugepages)\[char46] Changing this value requires restarting the daemon\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : dpdk-extra\fR: optional string"

.IP
Changing this value requires restarting the daemon\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : vhost-iommu-support\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
vHost IOMMU is a security feature, which restricts the vhost memory that a virtio device may access\[char46] vHost IOMMU support is disabled by default, due to a bug in QEMU implementations of the vhost REPLY_ACK protocol, (on which vHost IOMMU relies) prior to v2\[char46]9\[char46]1\[char46] Setting this value to \fBtrue\fR enables vHost IOMMU support for vHost User Client ports in OvS-DPDK, starting from DPDK v17\[char46]11\[char46]
.IP
Changing this value requires restarting the daemon\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : per-port-memory\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
By default OVS DPDK uses a shared memory model wherein devices that have the same MTU and socket values can share the same mempool\[char46] Setting this value to \fBtrue\fR changes this behaviour\[char46] Per port memory allow DPDK devices to use private memory per device\[char46] This can provide greater transparency as regards memory usage but potentially at the cost of greater memory requirements\[char46]
.IP
Changing this value requires restarting the daemon if dpdk-init has already been set to true\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : tx-flush-interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 0 to 1,000,000"
Specifies the time in microseconds that a packet can wait in output batch for sending i\[char46]e\[char46] amount of time that packet can spend in an intermediate output queue before sending to netdev\[char46] This option can be used to configure balance between throughput and latency\[char46] Lower values decreases latency while higher values may be useful to achieve higher performance\[char46]
.IP
Defaults to 0 i\[char46]e\[char46] instant packet sending (latency optimized)\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : pmd-perf-metrics\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Enables recording of detailed PMD performance metrics for analysis and trouble-shooting\[char46] This can have a performance impact in the order of 1%\[char46]
.IP
Defaults to false but can be changed at any time\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : smc-enable\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Signature match cache or SMC is a cache between EMC and megaflow cache\[char46] It does not store the full key of the flow, so it is more memory efficient comparing to EMC cache\[char46] SMC is especially useful when flow count is larger than EMC capacity\[char46]
.IP
Defaults to false but can be changed at any time\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : n-handler-threads\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
Specifies the number of threads for software datapaths to use for handling new flows\[char46] The default the number of online CPU cores minus the number of revalidators\[char46]
.IP
This configuration is per datapath\[char46] If you have more than one software datapath (e\[char46]g\[char46] some \fBsystem\fR bridges and some \fBnetdev\fR bridges), then the total number of threads is \fBn\-handler\-threads\fR times the number of software datapaths\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : n-revalidator-threads\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
Specifies the number of threads for software datapaths to use for revalidating flows in the datapath\[char46] Typically, there is a direct correlation between the number of revalidator threads, and the number of flows allowed in the datapath\[char46] The default is the number of cpu cores divided by four plus one\[char46] If \fBn\-handler\-threads\fR is set, the default changes to the number of cpu cores minus the number of handler threads\[char46]
.IP
This configuration is per datapath\[char46] If you have more than one software datapath (e\[char46]g\[char46] some \fBsystem\fR bridges and some \fBnetdev\fR bridges), then the total number of threads is \fBn\-handler\-threads\fR times the number of software datapaths\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : emc-insert-inv-prob\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295"
Specifies the inverse probability (1/emc-insert-inv-prob) of a flow being inserted into the Exact Match Cache (EMC)\[char46] On average one in every \fBemc\-insert\-inv\-prob\fR packets that generate a unique flow will cause an insertion into the EMC\[char46] A value of 1 will result in an insertion for every flow (1/1 = 100%) whereas a value of zero will result in no insertions and essentially disable the EMC\[char46]
.IP
Defaults to 100 ie\[char46] there is (1/100 =) 1% chance of EMC insertion\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : vlan-limit\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
Limits the number of VLAN headers that can be matched to the specified number\[char46] Further VLAN headers will be treated as payload, e\[char46]g\[char46] a packet with more 802\[char46]1q headers will match Ethernet type 0x8100\[char46]
.IP
Value \fB0\fR means unlimited\[char46] The actual number of supported VLAN headers is the smallest of \fBvlan\-limit\fR, the number of VLANs supported by Open vSwitch userspace (currently 2), and the number supported by the datapath\[char46]
.IP
If this value is absent, the default is currently 1\[char46] This maintains backward compatibility with controllers that were designed for use with Open vSwitch versions earlier than 2\[char46]8, which only supported one VLAN\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : bundle-idle-timeout\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
The maximum time (in seconds) that idle bundles will wait to be expired since it was either opened, modified or closed\[char46]
.IP
OpenFlow specification mandates the timeout to be at least one second\[char46] The default is 10 seconds\[char46]
.ST "Status:"
.PP
.IP "\fBnext_cfg\fR: integer"
Sequence number for client to increment\[char46] When a client modifies any part of the database configuration and wishes to wait for Open vSwitch to finish applying the changes, it may increment this sequence number\[char46]
.IP "\fBcur_cfg\fR: integer"
Sequence number that Open vSwitch sets to the current value of \fBnext_cfg\fR after it finishes applying a set of configuration changes\[char46]

The \fBstatistics\fR column contains key-value pairs that report statistics about a system running an Open vSwitch\[char46] These are updated periodically (currently, every 5 seconds)\[char46] Key-value pairs that cannot be determined or that do not apply to a platform are omitted\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : enable-statistics\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Statistics are disabled by default to avoid overhead in the common case when statistics gathering is not useful\[char46] Set this value to \fBtrue\fR to enable populating the \fBstatistics\fR column or to \fBfalse\fR to explicitly disable it\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatistics : cpu\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
Number of CPU processors, threads, or cores currently online and available to the operating system on which Open vSwitch is running, as an integer\[char46] This may be less than the number installed, if some are not online or if they are not available to the operating system\[char46]

If there are primary controllers, removing all of them clears the OpenFlow flow tables, group table, and meter table\[char46] If there are no primary controllers, adding one also clears these tables\[char46] Other changes to the set of controllers, such as adding or removing a service controller, adding another primary controller to supplement an existing primary controller, or removing only one of two primary controllers, have no effect on these tables\[char46]

Configuration for OpenFlow tables\[char46] Each pair maps from an OpenFlow table ID to configuration for that table\[char46]
.IP "\fBfail_mode\fR: optional string, either \fBsecure\fR or \fBstandalone\fR"
When a controller is configured, it is, ordinarily, responsible for setting up all flows on the switch\[char46] Thus, if the connection to the controller fails, no new network connections can be set up\[char46] If the connection to the controller stays down long enough, no packets can pass through the switch at all\[char46] This setting determines the switch\(cqs response to such a situation\[char46] It may be set to one of the following:
.RS
.TP
\fBstandalone\fR
If no message is received from the controller for three times the inactivity probe interval (see \fBinactivity_probe\fR), then Open vSwitch will take over responsibility for setting up flows\[char46] In this mode, Open vSwitch causes the bridge to act like an ordinary MAC-learning switch\[char46] Open vSwitch will continue to retry connecting to the controller in the background and, when the connection succeeds, it will discontinue its standalone behavior\[char46]
.TP
\fBsecure\fR
Open vSwitch will not set up flows on its own when the controller connection fails or when no controllers are defined\[char46] The bridge will continue to retry connecting to any defined controllers forever\[char46]
.RE
.IP
The default is \fBstandalone\fR if the value is unset, but future versions of Open vSwitch may change the default\[char46]
.IP
The \fBstandalone\fR mode can create forwarding loops on a bridge that has more than one uplink port unless STP is enabled\[char46] To avoid loops on such a bridge, configure \fBsecure\fR mode or enable STP (see \fBstp_enable\fR)\[char46]
.IP
When more than one controller is configured, \fBfail_mode\fR is considered only when none of the configured controllers can be contacted\[char46]

Changing \fBfail_mode\fR when no primary controllers are configured clears the OpenFlow flow tables, group table, and meter table\[char46]

.RS
.IP \(bu
When the kernel module included in the Open vSwitch source tree is used, this column reports the Open vSwitch version from which the module was taken\[char46]

Other datapaths (such as the Hyper-V kernel datapath) currently report \fB<unknown>\fR\[char46]
.RE
.IP
A version discrepancy between \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR and the datapath in use is not normally cause for alarm\[char46] The Open vSwitch kernel datapaths for Linux and Hyper-V, in particular, are designed for maximum inter-version compatibility: any userspace version works with with any kernel version\[char46] Some reasons do exist to insist on particular user/kernel pairings\[char46] First, newer kernel versions add new features, that can only be used by new-enough userspace, e\[char46]g\[char46] VXLAN tunneling requires certain minimal userspace and kernel versions\[char46] Second, as an extension to the first reason, some newer kernel versions add new features for enhancing performance that only new-enough userspace versions can take advantage of\[char46]

.ST "VLAN Configuration:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
In short, a VLAN (short for ``virtual LAN\(cq\(cq) is a way to partition a single switch into multiple switches\[char46] VLANs can be confusing, so for an introduction, please refer to the question ``What\(cqs a VLAN?\(cq\(cq in the Open vSwitch FAQ\[char46]
.PP
.PP
A VLAN is sometimes encoded into a packet using a 802\[char46]1Q or 802\[char46]1ad VLAN header, but every packet is part of some VLAN whether or not it is encoded in the packet\[char46] (A packet that appears to have no VLAN is part of VLAN 0, by default\[char46]) As a result, it\(cqs useful to think of a VLAN as a metadata property of a packet, separate from how the VLAN is encoded\[char46] For a given port, this column determines how the encoding of a packet that ingresses or egresses the port maps to the packet\(cqs VLAN\[char46] When a packet enters the switch, its VLAN is determined based on its setting in this column and its VLAN headers, if any, and then, conceptually, the VLAN headers are then stripped off\[char46] Conversely, when a packet exits the switch, its VLAN and the settings in this column determine what VLAN headers, if any, are pushed onto the packet before it egresses the port\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The VLAN configuration in this column affects Open vSwitch only when it is doing ``normal switching\[char46]\(cq\(cq It does not affect flows set up by an OpenFlow controller, outside of the OpenFlow ``normal action\[char46]\(cq\(cq
.PP
.PP
Bridge ports support the following types of VLAN configuration:
.RS
.TP
trunk
A trunk port carries packets on one or more specified VLANs specified in the \fBtrunks\fR column (often, on every VLAN)\[char46] A packet that ingresses on a trunk port is in the VLAN specified in its 802\[char46]1Q header, or VLAN 0 if the packet has no 802\[char46]1Q header\[char46] A packet that egresses through a trunk port will have an 802\[char46]1Q header if it has a nonzero VLAN ID\[char46]
.IP
Any packet that ingresses on a trunk port tagged with a VLAN that the port does not trunk is dropped\[char46]
.TP
access
An access port carries packets on exactly one VLAN specified in the \fBtag\fR column\[char46] Packets egressing on an access port have no 802\[char46]1Q header\[char46]
.IP
Any packet with an 802\[char46]1Q header with a nonzero VLAN ID that ingresses on an access port is dropped, regardless of whether the VLAN ID in the header is the access port\(cqs VLAN ID\[char46]
.TP
native-tagged
A native-tagged port resembles a trunk port, with the exception that a packet without an 802\[char46]1Q header that ingresses on a native-tagged port is in the ``native VLAN\(cq\(cq (specified in the \fBtag\fR column)\[char46]
.TP
native-untagged
A native-untagged port resembles a native-tagged port, with the exception that a packet that egresses on a native-untagged port in the native VLAN will not have an 802\[char46]1Q header\[char46]
.TP
dot1q-tunnel
A dot1q-tunnel port is somewhat like an access port\[char46] Like an access port, it carries packets on the single VLAN specified in the \fBtag\fR column and this VLAN, called the service VLAN, does not appear in an 802\[char46]1Q header for packets that ingress or egress on the port\[char46] The main difference lies in the behavior when packets that include a 802\[char46]1Q header ingress on the port\[char46] Whereas an access port drops such packets, a dot1q-tunnel port treats these as double-tagged with the outer service VLAN \fBtag\fR and the inner customer VLAN taken from the 802\[char46]1Q header\[char46] Correspondingly, to egress on the port, a packet outer VLAN (or only VLAN) must be \fBtag\fR, which is removed before egress, which exposes the inner (customer) VLAN if one is present\[char46]
.IP
If \fBcvlans\fR is set, only allows packets in the specified customer VLANs\[char46]
.RE
.PP
.PP
A packet will only egress through bridge ports that carry the VLAN of the packet, as described by the rules above\[char46]
.IP "\fBvlan_mode\fR: optional string, one of \fBaccess\fR, \fBdot1q\-tunnel\fR, \fBnative\-tagged\fR, \fBnative\-untagged\fR, or \fBtrunk\fR"
The VLAN mode of the port, as described above\[char46] When this column is empty, a default mode is selected as follows:
.RS
.IP \(bu
If \fBtag\fR contains a value, the port is an access port\[char46] The \fBtrunks\fR column should be empty\[char46]
.IP \(bu
Otherwise, the port is a trunk port\[char46] The \fBtrunks\fR column value is honored if it is present\[char46]
.RE
.IP "\fBtag\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095"
For an access port, the port\(cqs implicitly tagged VLAN\[char46] For a native-tagged or native-untagged port, the port\(cqs native VLAN\[char46] Must be empty if this is a trunk port\[char46]
.IP "\fBtrunks\fR: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095"
For a trunk, native-tagged, or native-untagged port, the 802\[char46]1Q VLAN or VLANs that this port trunks; if it is empty, then the port trunks all VLANs\[char46] Must be empty if this is an access port\[char46]
.IP
A native-tagged or native-untagged port always trunks its native VLAN, regardless of whether \fBtrunks\fR includes that VLAN\[char46]
.IP "\fBcvlans\fR: set of up to 4,096 integers, in range 0 to 4,095"
For a dot1q-tunnel port, the customer VLANs that this port includes\[char46] If this is empty, the port includes all customer VLANs\[char46]
.IP
For other kinds of ports, this setting is ignored\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : qinq-ethtype\fR: optional string, either \fB802\[char46]1ad\fR or \fB802\[char46]1q\fR"
For a dot1q-tunnel port, this is the TPID for the service tag, that is, for the 802\[char46]1Q header that contains the service VLAN ID\[char46] Because packets that actually ingress and egress a dot1q-tunnel port do not include an 802\[char46]1Q header for the service VLAN, this does not affect packets on the dot1q-tunnel port itself\[char46] Rather, it determines the service VLAN for a packet that ingresses on a dot1q-tunnel port and egresses on a trunk port\[char46]
.IP
The value \fB802\[char46]1ad\fR specifies TPID 0x88a8, which is also the default if the setting is omitted\[char46] The value \fB802\[char46]1q\fR specifies TPID 0x8100\[char46]
.IP
For other kinds of ports, this setting is ignored\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : priority-tags\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
An 802\[char46]1Q header contains two important pieces of information: a VLAN ID and a priority\[char46] A frame with a zero VLAN ID, called a ``priority-tagged\(cq\(cq frame, is supposed to be treated the same way as a frame without an 802\[char46]1Q header at all (except for the priority)\[char46]
.IP
However, some network elements ignore any frame that has 802\[char46]1Q header at all, even when the VLAN ID is zero\[char46] Therefore, by default Open vSwitch does not output priority-tagged frames, instead omitting the 802\[char46]1Q header entirely if the VLAN ID is zero\[char46] Set this key to \fBtrue\fR to enable priority-tagged frames on a port\[char46]
.IP
Regardless of this setting, Open vSwitch omits the 802\[char46]1Q header on output if both the VLAN ID and priority would be zero\[char46]
.IP
All frames output to native-tagged ports have a nonzero VLAN ID, so this setting is not meaningful on native-tagged ports\[char46]
.ST "Bonding Configuration:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
A port that has more than one interface is a ``bonded port\[char46]\(cq\(cq Bonding allows for load balancing and fail-over\[char46]
.PP
.PP
The following types of bonding will work with any kind of upstream switch\[char46] On the upstream switch, do not configure the interfaces as a bond:
.RS
.TP
\fBbalance\-slb\fR
Balances flows among slaves based on source MAC address and output VLAN, with periodic rebalancing as traffic patterns change\[char46]
.TP
\fBactive\-backup\fR
Assigns all flows to one slave, failing over to a backup slave when the active slave is disabled\[char46] This is the only bonding mode in which interfaces may be plugged into different upstream switches\[char46]
.RE
.PP
.PP
The following modes require the upstream switch to support 802\[char46]3ad with successful LACP negotiation\[char46] If LACP negotiation fails and other-config:lacp-fallback-ab is true, then \fBactive\-backup\fR mode is used:
.RS
.TP
\fBbalance\-tcp\fR
Balances flows among slaves based on L3 and L4 protocol information such as IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports\[char46]
.RE
.PP
.PP
These columns apply only to bonded ports\[char46] Their values are otherwise ignored\[char46]
.IP "\fBbond_mode\fR: optional string, one of \fBactive\-backup\fR, \fBbalance\-slb\fR, or \fBbalance\-tcp\fR"
The type of bonding used for a bonded port\[char46] Defaults to \fBactive\-backup\fR if unset\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : bond-hash-basis\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
An integer hashed along with flows when choosing output slaves in load balanced bonds\[char46] When changed, all flows will be assigned different hash values possibly causing slave selection decisions to change\[char46] Does not affect bonding modes which do not employ load balancing such as \fBactive\-backup\fR\[char46]
.ST "Link Failure Detection:"

.PP
.PP
An important part of link bonding is detecting that links are down so that they may be disabled\[char46] These settings determine how Open vSwitch detects link failure\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : bond-detect-mode\fR: optional string, either \fBcarrier\fR or \fBmiimon\fR"
The means used to detect link failures\[char46] Defaults to \fBcarrier\fR which uses each interface\(cqs carrier to detect failures\[char46] When set to \fBmiimon\fR, will check for failures by polling each interface\(cqs MII\[char46]

The number of milliseconds for which the link must stay up on an interface before the interface is considered to be up\[char46] Specify \fB0\fR to enable the interface immediately\[char46]
.IP
This setting is honored only when at least one bonded interface is already enabled\[char46] When no interfaces are enabled, then the first bond interface to come up is enabled immediately\[char46]
.IP "\fBbond_downdelay\fR: integer"
The number of milliseconds for which the link must stay down on an interface before the interface is considered to be down\[char46] Specify \fB0\fR to disable the interface immediately\[char46]

The LACP timing which should be used on this \fBPort\fR\[char46] By default \fBslow\fR is used\[char46] When configured to be \fBfast\fR LACP heartbeats are requested at a rate of once per second causing connectivity problems to be detected more quickly\[char46] In \fBslow\fR mode, heartbeats are requested at a rate of once every 30 seconds\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : lacp-fallback-ab\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
Determines the behavior of openvswitch bond in LACP mode\[char46] If the partner switch does not support LACP, setting this option to \fBtrue\fR allows openvswitch to fallback to active-backup\[char46] If the option is set to \fBfalse\fR, the bond will be disabled\[char46] In both the cases, once the partner switch is configured to LACP mode, the bond will use LACP\[char46]

.IP "\fBother_config : rstp-enable\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When RSTP is enabled on a bridge, it is enabled by default on all of the bridge\(cqs ports except bond, internal, and mirror ports (which do not work with RSTP)\[char46] If this column\(cqs value is \fBfalse\fR, RSTP is disabled on the port\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : rstp-port-priority\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 0 to 240"
The port\(cqs relative priority value for determining the root port, in multiples of 16\[char46] By default, the port priority is 0x80 (128)\[char46] Any value in the lower 4 bits is rounded off\[char46] The significant upper 4 bits become the upper 4 bits of the port-id\[char46] A port with the lowest port-id is elected as the root\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : rstp-port-num\fR: optional string, containing an integer, in range 1 to 4,095"
The local RSTP port number, used as the lower 12 bits of the port-id\[char46] By default the port numbers are assigned automatically, and typically may not correspond to the OpenFlow port numbers\[char46] A port with the lowest port-id is elected as the root\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : rstp-port-path-cost\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
The port path cost\[char46] The Port\(cqs contribution, when it is the Root Port, to the Root Path Cost for the Bridge\[char46] By default the cost is automatically calculated from the port\(cqs speed\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : rstp-port-admin-edge\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
The admin edge port parameter for the Port\[char46] Default is \fBfalse\fR\[char46]

The auto edge port parameter for the Port\[char46] Default is \fBtrue\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : rstp-port-mcheck\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
The mcheck port parameter for the Port\[char46] Default is \fBfalse\fR\[char46] May be set to force the Port Protocol Migration state machine to transmit RST BPDUs for a MigrateTime period, to test whether all STP Bridges on the attached LAN have been removed and the Port can continue to transmit RSTP BPDUs\[char46] Setting mcheck has no effect if the Bridge is operating in STP Compatibility mode\[char46]
.IP
Changing the value from \fBtrue\fR to \fBfalse\fR has no effect, but needs to be done if this behavior is to be triggered again by subsequently changing the value from \fBfalse\fR to \fBtrue\fR\[char46]

.IP "\fBname\fR: immutable string (must be unique within table)"
Interface name\[char46] Should be alphanumeric\[char46] For non-bonded port, this should be the same as the port name\[char46] It must otherwise be unique among the names of ports, interfaces, and bridges on a host\[char46]
.IP
The maximum length of an interface name depends on the underlying datapath:
.RS
.IP \(bu
The names of interfaces implemented as Linux and BSD network devices, including interfaces with type \fBinternal\fR, \fBtap\fR, or \fBsystem\fR plus the different types of tunnel ports, are limited to 15 bytes\[char46] Windows limits these names to 255 bytes\[char46]
.IP \(bu
The names of patch ports are not used in the underlying datapath, so operating system restrictions do not apply\[char46] Thus, they may have arbitrary length\[char46]
.RE
.IP
Regardless of other restrictions, OpenFlow only supports 15-byte names, which means that \fBovs\-ofctl\fR and OpenFlow controllers will show names truncated to 15 bytes\[char46]
.IP "\fBifindex\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,294,967,295"
A positive interface index as defined for SNMP MIB-II in RFCs 1213 and 2863, if the interface has one, otherwise 0\[char46] The ifindex is useful for seamless integration with protocols such as SNMP and sFlow\[char46]
.IP "\fBmac_in_use\fR: optional string"
The MAC address in use by this interface\[char46]
.IP "\fBmac\fR: optional string"
Ethernet address to set for this interface\[char46] If unset then the default MAC address is used:
.RS
.IP \(bu
For the local interface, the default is the lowest-numbered MAC address among the other bridge ports, either the value of the \fBmac\fR in its \fBPort\fR record, if set, or its actual MAC (for bonded ports, the MAC of its slave whose name is first in alphabetical order)\[char46] Internal ports and bridge ports that are used as port mirroring destinations (see the \fBMirror\fR table) are ignored\[char46]
.IP \(bu
For other internal interfaces, the default MAC is randomly generated\[char46]
.IP \(bu
External interfaces typically have a MAC address associated with their hardware\[char46]
.RE
.IP
Some interfaces may not have a software-controllable MAC address\[char46] This option only affects internal ports\[char46] For other type ports, you can change the MAC address outside Open vSwitch, using ip command\[char46]
.IP "\fBerror\fR: optional string"
If the configuration of the port failed, as indicated by \-1 in \fBofport\fR, Open vSwitch sets this column to an error description in human readable form\[char46] Otherwise, Open vSwitch clears this column\[char46]

When a client adds a new interface, Open vSwitch chooses an OpenFlow port number for the new port\[char46] If the client that adds the port fills in \fBofport_request\fR, then Open vSwitch tries to use its value as the OpenFlow port number\[char46] Otherwise, or if the requested port number is already in use or cannot be used for another reason, Open vSwitch automatically assigns a free port number\[char46] Regardless of how the port number was obtained, Open vSwitch then reports in \fBofport\fR the port number actually assigned\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Open vSwitch limits the port numbers that it automatically assigns to the range 1 through 32,767, inclusive\[char46] Controllers therefore have free use of ports 32,768 and up\[char46]
.IP "\fBofport\fR: optional integer"
OpenFlow port number for this interface\[char46] Open vSwitch sets this column\(cqs value, so other clients should treat it as read-only\[char46]
.IP
The OpenFlow ``local\(cq\(cq port (\fBOFPP_LOCAL\fR) is 65,534\[char46] The other valid port numbers are in the range 1 to 65,279, inclusive\[char46] Value \-1 indicates an error adding the interface\[char46]
.IP "\fBofport_request\fR: optional integer, in range 1 to 65,279"
Requested OpenFlow port number for this interface\[char46]
.IP
A client should ideally set this column\(cqs value in the same database transaction that it uses to create the interface\[char46] Open vSwitch version 2\[char46]1 and later will honor a later request for a specific port number, althuogh it might confuse some controllers: OpenFlow does not have a way to announce a port number change, so Open vSwitch represents it over OpenFlow as a port deletion followed immediately by a port addition\[char46]
.IP
If \fBofport_request\fR is set or changed to some other port\(cqs automatically assigned port number, Open vSwitch chooses a new port number for the latter port\[char46]

.IP "\fBtype\fR: string"
The interface type\[char46] The types supported by a particular instance of Open vSwitch are listed in the \fBiface_types\fR column in the \fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table\[char46] The following types are defined:
.RS
.TP
\fBsystem\fR
An ordinary network device, e\[char46]g\[char46] \fBeth0\fR on Linux\[char46] Sometimes referred to as ``external interfaces\(cq\(cq since they are generally connected to hardware external to that on which the Open vSwitch is running\[char46] The empty string is a synonym for \fBsystem\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fBinternal\fR
A simulated network device that sends and receives traffic\[char46] An internal interface whose \fBname\fR is the same as its bridge\(cqs \fBname\fR is called the ``local interface\[char46]\(cq\(cq It does not make sense to bond an internal interface, so the terms ``port\(cq\(cq and ``interface\(cq\(cq are often used imprecisely for internal interfaces\[char46]
.TP
\fBtap\fR
A TUN/TAP device managed by Open vSwitch\[char46]
.IP
Open vSwitch checks the interface state before send packets to the device\[char46] When it is \fBdown\fR, the packets are dropped and the tx_dropped statistic is updated accordingly\[char46] Older versions of Open vSwitch did not check the interface state and then the tx_packets was incremented along with tx_dropped\[char46]
.TP
\fBgeneve\fR
An Ethernet over Geneve (\fBhttp://tools\[char46]ietf\[char46]org/html/draft\-ietf\-nvo3\-geneve\fR) IPv4/IPv6 tunnel\[char46] A description of how to match and set Geneve options can be found in the \fBovs\-ofctl\fR manual page\[char46]
.TP
\fBgre\fR
Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) over IPv4/IPv6 tunnel, configurable to encapsulate layer 2 or layer 3 traffic\[char46]
.TP
\fBvxlan\fR
An Ethernet tunnel over the UDP-based VXLAN protocol described in RFC 7348\[char46]
.IP
Open vSwitch uses IANA-assigned UDP destination port 4789\[char46] The source port used for VXLAN traffic varies on a per-flow basis and is in the ephemeral port range\[char46]
.TP
\fBlisp\fR
A layer 3 tunnel over the experimental, UDP-based Locator/ID Separation Protocol (RFC 6830)\[char46]
.IP
Only IPv4 and IPv6 packets are supported by the protocol, and they are sent and received without an Ethernet header\[char46] Traffic to/from LISP ports is expected to be configured explicitly, and the ports are not intended to participate in learning based switching\[char46] As such, they are always excluded from packet flooding\[char46]
.TP
\fBstt\fR
The Stateless TCP Tunnel (STT) is particularly useful when tunnel endpoints are in end-systems, as it utilizes the capabilities of standard network interface cards to improve performance\[char46] STT utilizes a TCP-like header inside the IP header\[char46] It is stateless, i\[char46]e\[char46], there is no TCP connection state of any kind associated with the tunnel\[char46] The TCP-like header is used to leverage the capabilities of existing network interface cards, but should not be interpreted as implying any sort of connection state between endpoints\[char46] Since the STT protocol does not engage in the usual TCP 3-way handshake, so it will have difficulty traversing stateful firewalls\[char46] The protocol is documented at https://tools\[char46]ietf\[char46]org/html/draft-davie-stt All traffic uses a default destination port of 7471\[char46]

.ST "Ingress Policing:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
These settings control ingress policing for packets received on this interface\[char46] On a physical interface, this limits the rate at which traffic is allowed into the system from the outside; on a virtual interface (one connected to a virtual machine), this limits the rate at which the VM is able to transmit\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Policing is a simple form of quality-of-service that simply drops packets received in excess of the configured rate\[char46] Due to its simplicity, policing is usually less accurate and less effective than egress QoS (which is configured using the \fBQoS\fR and \fBQueue\fR tables)\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Policing is currently implemented on Linux and OVS with DPDK\[char46] Both implementations use a simple ``token bucket\(cq\(cq approach:
.RS
.IP \(bu
The size of the bucket corresponds to \fBingress_policing_burst\fR\[char46] Initially the bucket is full\[char46]
.IP \(bu
Whenever a packet is received, its size (converted to tokens) is compared to the number of tokens currently in the bucket\[char46] If the required number of tokens are available, they are removed and the packet is forwarded\[char46] Otherwise, the packet is dropped\[char46]
.IP \(bu
Whenever it is not full, the bucket is refilled with tokens at the rate specified by \fBingress_policing_rate\fR\[char46]
.RE
.PP
.PP
Policing interacts badly with some network protocols, and especially with fragmented IP packets\[char46] Suppose that there is enough network activity to keep the bucket nearly empty all the time\[char46] Then this token bucket algorithm will forward a single packet every so often, with the period depending on packet size and on the configured rate\[char46] All of the fragments of an IP packets are normally transmitted back-to-back, as a group\[char46] In such a situation, therefore, only one of these fragments will be forwarded and the rest will be dropped\[char46] IP does not provide any way for the intended recipient to ask for only the remaining fragments\[char46] In such a case there are two likely possibilities for what will happen next: either all of the fragments will eventually be retransmitted (as TCP will do), in which case the same problem will recur, or the sender will not realize that its packet has been dropped and data will simply be lost (as some UDP-based protocols will do)\[char46] Either way, it is possible that no forward progress will ever occur\[char46]
.IP "\fBingress_policing_rate\fR: integer, at least 0"
Maximum rate for data received on this interface, in kbps\[char46] Data received faster than this rate is dropped\[char46] Set to \fB0\fR (the default) to disable policing\[char46]
.IP "\fBingress_policing_burst\fR: integer, at least 0"
Maximum burst size for data received on this interface, in kb\[char46] The default burst size if set to \fB0\fR is 8000 kbit\[char46] This value has no effect if \fBingress_policing_rate\fR is \fB0\fR\[char46]
.IP
Specifying a larger burst size lets the algorithm be more forgiving, which is important for protocols like TCP that react severely to dropped packets\[char46] The burst size should be at least the size of the interface\(cqs MTU\[char46] Specifying a value that is numerically at least as large as 80% of \fBingress_policing_rate\fR helps TCP come closer to achieving the full rate\[char46]
.ST "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD):"
.PP
.PP
.PP
BFD, defined in RFC 5880 and RFC 5881, allows point-to-point detection of connectivity failures by occasional transmission of BFD control messages\[char46] Open vSwitch implements BFD to serve as a more popular and standards compliant alternative to CFM\[char46]
.PP
.PP
BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a rate negotiated independently in each direction\[char46] Each endpoint specifies the rate at which it expects to receive control messages, and the rate at which it is willing to transmit them\[char46] By default, Open vSwitch uses a detection multiplier of three, meaning that an endpoint signals a connectivity fault if three consecutive BFD control messages fail to arrive\[char46] In the case of a unidirectional connectivity issue, the system not receiving BFD control messages signals the problem to its peer in the messages it transmits\[char46]

802\[char46]1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) allows a group of Maintenance Points (MPs) called a Maintenance Association (MA) to detect connectivity problems with each other\[char46] MPs within a MA should have complete and exclusive interconnectivity\[char46] This is verified by occasionally broadcasting Continuity Check Messages (CCMs) at a configurable transmission interval\[char46]
.PP

According to the 802\[char46]1ag specification, each Maintenance Point should be configured out-of-band with a list of Remote Maintenance Points it should have connectivity to\[char46] Open vSwitch differs from the specification in this area\[char46] It simply assumes the link is faulted if no Remote Maintenance Points are reachable, and considers it not faulted otherwise\[char46]

According to the 802\[char46]1ag specification, MPIDs can only range between [1, 8191]\[char46] However, extended mode (see \fBother_config:cfm_extended\fR) supports eight byte MPIDs\[char46]

Indicates a connectivity fault triggered by an inability to receive heartbeats from any remote endpoint\[char46] When a fault is triggered on \fBInterface\fRs participating in bonds, they will be disabled\[char46]
.IP
Faults can be triggered for several reasons\[char46] Most importantly they are triggered when no CCMs are received for a period of 3\[char46]5 times the transmission interval\[char46] Faults are also triggered when any CCMs indicate that a Remote Maintenance Point is not receiving CCMs but able to send them\[char46] Finally, a fault is triggered if a CCM is received which indicates unexpected configuration\[char46] Notably, this case arises when a CCM is received which advertises the local MPID\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : recv\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to a lack of CCMs received on the \fBInterface\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : rdi\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception of a CCM with the RDI bit flagged\[char46] Endpoints set the RDI bit in their CCMs when they are not receiving CCMs themselves\[char46] This typically indicates a unidirectional connectivity failure\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : maid\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception of a CCM with a MAID other than the one Open vSwitch uses\[char46] CFM broadcasts are tagged with an identification number in addition to the MPID called the MAID\[char46] Open vSwitch only supports receiving CCM broadcasts tagged with the MAID it uses internally\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : loopback\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered due to the reception of a CCM advertising the same MPID configured in the \fBcfm_mpid\fR column of this \fBInterface\fR\[char46] This may indicate a loop in the network\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : overflow\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was triggered because the CFM module received CCMs from more remote endpoints than it can keep track of\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_fault_status : override\fR: none"
Indicates a CFM fault was manually triggered by an administrator using an \fBovs\-appctl\fR command\[char46]

.IP "\fBcfm_health\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 100"
Indicates the health of the interface as a percentage of CCM frames received over 21 \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fRs\[char46] The health of an interface is undefined if it is communicating with more than one \fBcfm_remote_mpids\fR\[char46] It reduces if healthy heartbeats are not received at the expected rate, and gradually improves as healthy heartbeats are received at the desired rate\[char46] Every 21 \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fRs, the health of the interface is refreshed\[char46]
.IP
As mentioned above, the faults can be triggered for several reasons\[char46] The link health will deteriorate even if heartbeats are received but they are reported to be unhealthy\[char46] An unhealthy heartbeat in this context is a heartbeat for which either some fault is set or is out of sequence\[char46] The interface health can be 100 only on receiving healthy heartbeats at the desired rate\[char46]
.IP "\fBcfm_remote_mpids\fR: set of integers"
When CFM is properly configured, Open vSwitch will occasionally receive CCM broadcasts\[char46] These broadcasts contain the MPID of the sending Maintenance Point\[char46] The list of MPIDs from which this \fBInterface\fR is receiving broadcasts from is regularly collected and written to this column\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_interval\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
The interval, in milliseconds, between transmissions of CFM heartbeats\[char46] Three missed heartbeat receptions indicate a connectivity fault\[char46]

We do not recommend using intervals less than 100 ms\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_extended\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBtrue\fR, the CFM module operates in extended mode\[char46] This causes it to use a nonstandard destination address to avoid conflicting with compliant implementations which may be running concurrently on the network\[char46] Furthermore, extended mode increases the accuracy of the \fBcfm_interval\fR configuration parameter by breaking wire compatibility with 802\[char46]1ag compliant implementations\[char46] And extended mode allows eight byte MPIDs\[char46] Defaults to \fBfalse\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_demand\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"
When \fBtrue\fR, and \fBother_config:cfm_extended\fR is true, the CFM module operates in demand mode\[char46] When in demand mode, traffic received on the \fBInterface\fR is used to indicate liveness\[char46] CCMs are still transmitted and received\[char46] At least one CCM must be received every 100 * \fBother_config:cfm_interval\fR amount of time\[char46] Otherwise, even if traffic are received, the CFM module will raise the connectivity fault\[char46]

To ensure that ovs-vswitchd has enough time to pull statistics from the datapath, the fault detection interval is set to 3\[char46]5 * MAX(\fBother_config:cfm_interval\fR, 500) ms\[char46]
.IP \(bu
To avoid ambiguity, demand mode disables itself when there are multiple remote maintenance points\[char46]
.IP \(bu
If the \fBInterface\fR is heavily congested, CCMs containing the \fBother_config:cfm_opstate\fR status may be dropped causing changes in the operational state to be delayed\[char46] Similarly, if CCMs containing the RDI bit are not received, unidirectional link failures may not be detected\[char46]
.RE
.IP "\fBother_config : cfm_opstate\fR: optional string, either \fBdown\fR or \fBup\fR"
When \fBdown\fR, the CFM module marks all CCMs it generates as operationally down without triggering a fault\[char46] This allows remote maintenance points to choose not to forward traffic to the \fBInterface\fR on which this CFM module is running\[char46] Currently, in Open vSwitch, the opdown bit of CCMs affects \fBInterface\fRs participating in bonds, and the bundle OpenFlow action\[char46] This setting is ignored when CFM is not in extended mode\[char46] Defaults to \fBup\fR\[char46]

Open vSwitch supports limiting the number of flows that may be installed in a flow table, via the \fBflow_limit\fR column\[char46] When adding a flow would exceed this limit, by default Open vSwitch reports an error, but there are two ways to configure Open vSwitch to instead delete (``evict\(cq\(cq) a flow to make room for the new one:

When a flow must be evicted due to overflow, the flow to evict is chosen through an approximation of the following algorithm\[char46] This algorithm is used regardless of how eviction was enabled:
.RS
.IP 1. .25in
Divide the flows in the table into groups based on the values of the fields or subfields specified in the \fBgroups\fR column, so that all of the flows in a given group have the same values for those fields\[char46] If a flow does not specify a given field, that field\(cqs value is treated as 0\[char46] If \fBgroups\fR is empty, then all of the flows in the flow table are treated as a single group\[char46]

.IP "\fBprefixes\fR: set of up to 3 strings"
This string set specifies which fields should be used for address prefix tracking\[char46] Prefix tracking allows the classifier to skip rules with longer than necessary prefixes, resulting in better wildcarding for datapath flows\[char46]
.IP
Prefix tracking may be beneficial when a flow table contains matches on IP address fields with different prefix lengths\[char46] For example, when a flow table contains IP address matches on both full addresses and proper prefixes, the full address matches will typically cause the datapath flow to un-wildcard the whole address field (depending on flow entry priorities)\[char46] In this case each packet with a different address gets handed to the userspace for flow processing and generates its own datapath flow\[char46] With prefix tracking enabled for the address field in question packets with addresses matching shorter prefixes would generate datapath flows where the irrelevant address bits are wildcarded, allowing the same datapath flow to handle all the packets within the prefix in question\[char46] In this case many userspace upcalls can be avoided and the overall performance can be better\[char46]
.IP
This is a performance optimization only, so packets will receive the same treatment with or without prefix tracking\[char46]
.IP
The supported fields are: \fBtun_id\fR, \fBtun_src\fR, \fBtun_dst\fR, \fBtun_ipv6_src\fR, \fBtun_ipv6_dst\fR, \fBnw_src\fR, \fBnw_dst\fR (or aliases \fBip_src\fR and \fBip_dst\fR), \fBipv6_src\fR, and \fBipv6_dst\fR\[char46] (Using this feature for \fBtun_id\fR would only make sense if the tunnel IDs have prefix structure similar to IP addresses\[char46])
.IP
By default, the \fBprefixes=ip_dst,ip_src\fR are used on each flow table\[char46] This instructs the flow classifier to track the IP destination and source addresses used by the rules in this specific flow table\[char46]
.IP
The keyword \fBnone\fR is recognized as an explicit override of the default values, causing no prefix fields to be tracked\[char46]
.IP
To set the prefix fields, the flow table record needs to exist:
.RS
.TP
\fBovs\-vsctl set Bridge br0 flow_tables:0=@N1 \-\- \-\-id=@N1 create Flow_Table name=table0\fR

\fBPlease note:\fR Mirroring to a VLAN can disrupt a network that contains unmanaged switches\[char46] Consider an unmanaged physical switch with two ports: port 1, connected to an end host, and port 2, connected to an Open vSwitch configured to mirror received packets into VLAN 123 on port 2\[char46] Suppose that the end host sends a packet on port 1 that the physical switch forwards to port 2\[char46] The Open vSwitch forwards this packet to its destination and then reflects it back on port 2 in VLAN 123\[char46] This reflected packet causes the unmanaged physical switch to replace the MAC learning table entry, which correctly pointed to port 1, with one that incorrectly points to port 2\[char46] Afterward, the physical switch will direct packets destined for the end host to the Open vSwitch on port 2, instead of to the end host on port 1, disrupting connectivity\[char46] If mirroring to a VLAN is desired in this scenario, then the physical switch must be replaced by one that learns Ethernet addresses on a per-VLAN basis\[char46] In addition, learning should be disabled on the VLAN containing mirrored traffic\[char46] If this is not done then intermediate switches will learn the MAC address of each end host from the mirrored traffic\[char46] If packets being sent to that end host are also mirrored, then they will be dropped since the switch will attempt to send them out the input port\[char46] Disabling learning for the VLAN will cause the switch to correctly send the packet out all ports configured for that VLAN\[char46] If Open vSwitch is being used as an intermediate switch, learning can be disabled by adding the mirrored VLAN to \fBflood_vlans\fR in the appropriate \fBBridge\fR table or tables\[char46]

An OpenFlow controller\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Open vSwitch supports two kinds of OpenFlow controllers:
.RS
.TP
Primary controllers
This is the kind of controller envisioned by the OpenFlow 1\[char46]0 specification\[char46] Usually, a primary controller implements a network policy by taking charge of the switch\(cqs flow table\[char46]
.IP
Open vSwitch initiates and maintains persistent connections to primary controllers, retrying the connection each time it fails or drops\[char46] The \fBfail_mode\fR column in the \fBBridge\fR table applies to primary controllers\[char46]
.IP
Open vSwitch permits a bridge to have any number of primary controllers\[char46] When multiple controllers are configured, Open vSwitch connects to all of them simultaneously\[char46] Because OpenFlow 1\[char46]0 does not specify how multiple controllers coordinate in interacting with a single switch, more than one primary controller should be specified only if the controllers are themselves designed to coordinate with each other\[char46] (The Nicira-defined \fBNXT_ROLE\fR OpenFlow vendor extension may be useful for this\[char46])
.TP
Service controllers
These kinds of OpenFlow controller connections are intended for occasional support and maintenance use, e\[char46]g\[char46] with \fBovs\-ofctl\fR\[char46] Usually a service controller connects only briefly to inspect or modify some of a switch\(cqs state\[char46]
.IP
Open vSwitch listens for incoming connections from service controllers\[char46] The service controllers initiate and, if necessary, maintain the connections from their end\[char46] The \fBfail_mode\fR column in the \fBBridge\fR table does not apply to service controllers\[char46]

When multiple controllers are configured for a single bridge, the \fBtarget\fR values must be unique\[char46] Duplicate \fBtarget\fR values yield unspecified results\[char46]
.IP "\fBconnection_mode\fR: optional string, either \fBin\-band\fR or \fBout\-of\-band\fR"
If it is specified, this setting must be one of the following strings that describes how Open vSwitch contacts this OpenFlow controller over the network:
.RS
.TP
\fBin\-band\fR
In this mode, this controller\(cqs OpenFlow traffic travels over the bridge associated with the controller\[char46] With this setting, Open vSwitch allows traffic to and from the controller regardless of the contents of the OpenFlow flow table\[char46] (Otherwise, Open vSwitch would never be able to connect to the controller, because it did not have a flow to enable it\[char46]) This is the most common connection mode because it is not necessary to maintain two independent networks\[char46]
.TP
\fBout\-of\-band\fR
In this mode, OpenFlow traffic uses a control network separate from the bridge associated with this controller, that is, the bridge does not use any of its own network devices to communicate with the controller\[char46] The control network must be configured separately, before or after \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR is started\[char46]
.RE
.IP
If not specified, the default is implementation-specific\[char46]
.ST "Controller Failure Detection and Handling:"
.PP
.IP "\fBmax_backoff\fR: optional integer, at least 1,000"
Maximum number of milliseconds to wait between connection attempts\[char46] Default is implementation-specific\[char46]
.IP "\fBinactivity_probe\fR: optional integer"
Maximum number of milliseconds of idle time on connection to controller before sending an inactivity probe message\[char46] If Open vSwitch does not communicate with the controller for the specified number of seconds, it will send a probe\[char46] If a response is not received for the same additional amount of time, Open vSwitch assumes the connection has been broken and attempts to reconnect\[char46] Default is implementation-specific\[char46] A value of 0 disables inactivity probes\[char46]
.ST "Asynchronous Messages:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
OpenFlow switches send certain messages to controllers spontanenously, that is, not in response to any request from the controller\[char46] These messages are called ``asynchronous messages\[char46]\(cq\(cq These columns allow asynchronous messages to be limited or disabled to ensure the best use of network resources\[char46]
.IP "\fBenable_async_messages\fR: optional boolean"
The OpenFlow protocol enables asynchronous messages at time of connection establishment, which means that a controller can receive asynchronous messages, potentially many of them, even if it turns them off immediately after connecting\[char46] Set this column to \fBfalse\fR to change Open vSwitch behavior to disable, by default, all asynchronous messages\[char46] The controller can use the \fBNXT_SET_ASYNC_CONFIG\fR Nicira extension to OpenFlow to turn on any messages that it does want to receive, if any\[char46]
.ST "Controller Rate Limiting:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
A switch can forward packets to a controller over the OpenFlow protocol\[char46] Forwarding packets this way at too high a rate can overwhelm a controller, frustrate use of the OpenFlow connection for other purposes, increase the latency of flow setup, and use an unreasonable amount of bandwidth\[char46] Therefore, Open vSwitch supports limiting the rate of packet forwarding to a controller\[char46]
.PP
.PP
There are two main reasons in OpenFlow for a packet to be sent to a controller: either the packet ``misses\(cq\(cq in the flow table, that is, there is no matching flow, or a flow table action says to send the packet to the controller\[char46] Open vSwitch limits the rate of each kind of packet separately at the configured rate\[char46] Therefore, the actual rate that packets are sent to the controller can be up to twice the configured rate, when packets are sent for both reasons\[char46]
.PP
.PP
This feature is specific to forwarding packets over an OpenFlow connection\[char46] It is not general-purpose QoS\[char46] See the \fBQoS\fR table for quality of service configuration, and \fBingress_policing_rate\fR in the \fBInterface\fR table for ingress policing configuration\[char46]
.IP "\fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR: optional integer, at least 100"
The maximum rate at which the switch will forward packets to the OpenFlow controller, in packets per second\[char46] If no value is specified, rate limiting is disabled\[char46]
.IP "\fBcontroller_burst_limit\fR: optional integer, at least 25"
When a high rate triggers rate-limiting, Open vSwitch queues packets to the controller for each port and transmits them to the controller at the configured rate\[char46] This value limits the number of queued packets\[char46] Ports on a bridge share the packet queue fairly\[char46]
.IP
This value has no effect unless \fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR is configured\[char46] The current default when this value is not specified is one-quarter of \fBcontroller_rate_limit\fR, meaning that queuing can delay forwarding a packet to the controller by up to 250 ms\[char46]
.ST "Controller Rate Limiting Statistics:"
.PP
.PP
.PP
These values report the effects of rate limiting\[char46] Their values are relative to establishment of the most recent OpenFlow connection, or since rate limiting was enabled, whichever happened more recently\[char46] Each consists of two values, one with \fBTYPE\fR replaced by \fBmiss\fR for rate limiting flow table misses, and the other with \fBTYPE\fR replaced by \fBaction\fR for rate limiting packets sent by OpenFlow actions\[char46]
.PP
.PP
These statistics are reported only when controller rate limiting is enabled\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatus : packet-in-TYPE-bypassed\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
Number of packets sent directly to the controller, without queuing, because the rate did not exceed the configured maximum\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatus : packet-in-TYPE-queued\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
Number of packets added to the queue to send later\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatus : packet-in-TYPE-dropped\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
Number of packets added to the queue that were later dropped due to overflow\[char46] This value is less than or equal to \fBstatus:packet-in-TYPE-queued\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBstatus : packet-in-TYPE-backlog\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 0"
Number of packets currently queued\[char46] The other statistics increase monotonically, but this one fluctuates between 0 and the \fBcontroller_burst_limit\fR as conditions change\[char46]

Auto Attach configuration within a bridge\[char46] The IETF Auto-Attach SPBM draft standard describes a compact method of using IEEE 802\[char46]1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) together with a IEEE 802\[char46]1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) network to automatically attach network devices to individual services in a SPB network\[char46] The intent here is to allow network applications and devices using OVS to be able to easily take advantage of features offered by industry standard SPB networks\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Auto Attach (AA) uses LLDP to communicate between a directly connected Auto Attach Client (AAC) and Auto Attach Server (AAS)\[char46] The LLDP protocol is extended to add two new Type-Length-Value tuples (TLVs)\[char46] The first new TLV supports the ongoing discovery of directly connected AA correspondents\[char46] Auto Attach operates by regularly transmitting AA discovery TLVs between the AA client and AA server\[char46] By exchanging these discovery messages, both the AAC and AAS learn the system name and system description of their peer\[char46] In the OVS context, OVS operates as the AA client and the AA server resides on a switch at the edge of the SPB network\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Once AA discovery has been completed the AAC then uses the second new TLV to deliver identifier mappings from the AAC to the AAS\[char46] A primary feature of Auto Attach is to facilitate the mapping of VLANs defined outside the SPB network onto service ids (ISIDs) defined within the SPM network\[char46] By doing so individual external VLANs can be mapped onto specific SPB network services\[char46] These VLAN id to ISID mappings can be configured and managed locally using new options added to the ovs-vsctl command\[char46]

The Auto Attach OVS feature does not provide a full implementation of the LLDP protocol\[char46] Support for the mandatory TLVs as defined by the LLDP standard and support for the AA TLV extensions is provided\[char46] LLDP protocol support in OVS can be enabled or disabled on a port by port basis\[char46] LLDP support is disabled by default\[char46]
