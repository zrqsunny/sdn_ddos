ovn-northd \- Open Virtual Network central control daemon
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBovn\-northd\fR [\fIoptions\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.PP
\fBovn\-northd\fR is a centralized daemon responsible for translating the high-level OVN configuration into logical configuration consumable by daemons such as \fBovn\-controller\fR\[char46] It translates the logical network configuration in terms of conventional network concepts, taken from the OVN Northbound Database (see \fBovn\-nb\fR(5)), into logical datapath flows in the OVN Southbound Database (see \fBovn\-sb\fR(5)) below it\[char46]
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-\-ovnnb\-db=\fIdatabase\fB\fR
The OVSDB database containing the OVN Northbound Database\[char46] If the \fBOVN_NB_DB\fR environment variable is set, its value is used as the default\[char46] Otherwise, the default is \fBunix:/var/run/openvswitch/ovnnb_db\[char46]sock\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-ovnsb\-db=\fIdatabase\fB\fR
The OVSDB database containing the OVN Southbound Database\[char46] If the \fBOVN_SB_DB\fR environment variable is set, its value is used as the default\[char46] Otherwise, the default is \fBunix:/var/run/openvswitch/ovnsb_db\[char46]sock\fR\[char46]
.PP
.PP
\fIdatabase\fR in the above options must be an OVSDB active or passive connection method, as described in \fBovsdb\fR(7)\[char46]
.SS "Daemon Options"
.TP
\fB\-\-pidfile\fR[\fB=\fR\fIpidfile\fR]
Causes a file (by default, \fB\fIprogram\fB\[char46]pid\fR) to be created indicating the PID of the running process\[char46] If the \fIpidfile\fR argument is not specified, or if it does not begin with \fB/\fR, then it is created in \fB/var/run/openvswitch\fR\[char46]
.IP
If \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, no pidfile is created\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is specified and the specified pidfile already exists and is locked by a running process, the daemon refuses to start\[char46] Specify \fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR to cause it to instead overwrite the pidfile\[char46]
.IP
When \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, this option has no effect\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-detach\fR
Runs this program as a background process\[char46] The process forks, and in the child it starts a new session, closes the standard file descriptors (which has the side effect of disabling logging to the console), and changes its current directory to the root (unless \fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR is specified)\[char46] After the child completes its initialization, the parent exits\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-monitor\fR
Creates an additional process to monitor this program\[char46] If it dies due to a signal that indicates a programming error (\fBSIGABRT\fR, \fBSIGALRM\fR, \fBSIGBUS\fR, \fBSIGFPE\fR, \fBSIGILL\fR, \fBSIGPIPE\fR, \fBSIGSEGV\fR, \fBSIGXCPU\fR, or \fBSIGXFSZ\fR) then the monitor process starts a new copy of it\[char46] If the daemon dies or exits for another reason, the monitor process exits\[char46]
.IP
This option is normally used with \fB\-\-detach\fR, but it also functions without it\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, the daemon changes its current working directory to the root directory after it detaches\[char46] Otherwise, invoking the daemon from a carelessly chosen directory would prevent the administrator from unmounting the file system that holds that directory\[char46]
.IP
Specifying \fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR suppresses this behavior, preventing the daemon from changing its current working directory\[char46] This may be useful for collecting core files, since it is common behavior to write core dumps into the current working directory and the root directory is not a good directory to use\[char46]
.IP
This option has no effect when \fB\-\-detach\fR is not specified\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-self\-confinement\fR
By default this daemon will try to self-confine itself to work with files under well-known directories whitelisted at build time\[char46] It is better to stick with this default behavior and not to use this flag unless some other Access Control is used to confine daemon\[char46] Note that in contrast to other access control implementations that are typically enforced from kernel-space (e\[char46]g\[char46] DAC or MAC), self-confinement is imposed from the user-space daemon itself and hence should not be considered as a full confinement strategy, but instead should be viewed as an additional layer of security\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-user=\fR\fIuser\fR\fB:\fR\fIgroup\fR
Causes this program to run as a different user specified in \fIuser\fR\fB:\fR\fIgroup\fR, thus dropping most of the root privileges\[char46] Short forms \fIuser\fR and \fB:\fR\fIgroup\fR are also allowed, with current user or group assumed, respectively\[char46] Only daemons started by the root user accepts this argument\[char46]
.IP
On Linux, daemons will be granted \fBCAP_IPC_LOCK\fR and \fBCAP_NET_BIND_SERVICES\fR before dropping root privileges\[char46] Daemons that interact with a datapath, such as \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR, will be granted three additional capabilities, namely \fBCAP_NET_ADMIN\fR, \fBCAP_NET_BROADCAST\fR and \fBCAP_NET_RAW\fR\[char46] The capability change will apply even if the new user is root\[char46]
.IP
On Windows, this option is not currently supported\[char46] For security reasons, specifying this option will cause the daemon process not to start\[char46]
.SS "Logging Options"
.TP
\fB\-v\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-verbose=\fR[\fIspec\fR]
Sets logging levels\[char46] Without any \fIspec\fR, sets the log level for every module and destination to \fBdbg\fR\[char46] Otherwise, \fIspec\fR is a list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from each category below:
.RS
.IP \(bu
A valid module name, as displayed by the \fBvlog/list\fR command on \fBovs\-appctl\fR(8), limits the log level change to the specified module\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR, to limit the log level change to only to the system log, to the console, or to a file, respectively\[char46] (If \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, the daemon closes its standard file descriptors, so logging to the console will have no effect\[char46])
.IP
On Windows platform, \fBsyslog\fR is accepted as a word and is only useful along with the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option (the word has no effect otherwise)\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or \fBdbg\fR, to control the log level\[char46] Messages of the given severity or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be filtered out\[char46] \fBoff\fR filters out all messages\[char46] See \fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level\[char46]
.RE
.IP
Case is not significant within \fIspec\fR\[char46]
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file will not take place unless \fB\-\-log\-file\fR is also specified (see below)\[char46]
.IP
For compatibility with older versions of OVS, \fBany\fR is accepted as a word but has no effect\[char46]

.TP
\fB\-vFACILITY:\fR\fIfacility\fR
.TQ .5in
\fB\-\-verbose=FACILITY:\fR\fIfacility\fR
Sets the RFC5424 facility of the log message\[char46] \fIfacility\fR can be one of \fBkern\fR, \fBuser\fR, \fBmail\fR, \fBdaemon\fR, \fBauth\fR, \fBsyslog\fR, \fBlpr\fR, \fBnews\fR, \fBuucp\fR, \fBclock\fR, \fBftp\fR, \fBntp\fR, \fBaudit\fR, \fBalert\fR, \fBclock2\fR, \fBlocal0\fR, \fBlocal1\fR, \fBlocal2\fR, \fBlocal3\fR, \fBlocal4\fR, \fBlocal5\fR, \fBlocal6\fR or \fBlocal7\fR\[char46] If this option is not specified, \fBdaemon\fR is used as the default for the local system syslog and \fBlocal0\fR is used while sending a message to the target provided via the \fB\-\-syslog\-target\fR option\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR[\fB=\fR\fIfile\fR]
Enables logging to a file\[char46] If \fIfile\fR is specified, then it is used as the exact name for the log file\[char46] The default log file name used if \fIfile\fR is omitted is \fB/var/log/openvswitch/\fIprogram\fB\[char46]log\fR\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-syslog\-target=\fR\fIhost\fR\fB:\fR\fIport\fR
Send syslog messages to UDP \fIport\fR on \fIhost\fR, in addition to the system syslog\[char46] The \fIhost\fR must be a numerical IP address, not a hostname\[char46]
.TP
\fB\-\-syslog\-method=\fR\fImethod\fR
Specify \fImethod\fR as how syslog messages should be sent to syslog daemon\[char46] The following forms are supported:
.RS
.IP \(bu
\fBlibc\fR, to use the libc \fBsyslog()\fR function\[char46] This is the default behavior\[char46] Downside of using this options is that libc adds fixed prefix to every message before it is actually sent to the syslog daemon over \fB/dev/log\fR UNIX domain socket\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fBunix:\fIfile\fB\fR, to use a UNIX domain socket directly\[char46] It is possible to specify arbitrary message format with this option\[char46] However, \fBrsyslogd 8\[char46]9\fR and older versions use hard coded parser function anyway that limits UNIX domain socket use\[char46] If you want to use arbitrary message format with older \fBrsyslogd\fR versions, then use UDP socket to localhost IP address instead\[char46]
.IP \(bu
\fBudp:\fIip\fB:\fIport\fB\fR, to use a UDP socket\[char46] With this method it is possible to use arbitrary message format also with older \fBrsyslogd\fR\[char46] When sending syslog messages over UDP socket extra precaution needs to be taken into account, for example, syslog daemon needs to be configured to listen on the specified UDP port, accidental iptables rules could be interfering with local syslog traffic and there are some security considerations that apply to UDP sockets, but do not apply to UNIX domain sockets\[char46]

.TP
\fB\-C none\fR

\fB\-\-unixctl=\fIsocket\fB\fR
Sets the name of the control socket on which \fB\fIprogram\fB\fR listens for runtime management commands (see \fIRUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS,\fR below)\[char46] If \fIsocket\fR does not begin with \fB/\fR, it is interpreted as relative to \fB/var/run/openvswitch\fR\[char46] If \fB\-\-unixctl\fR is not used at all, the default socket is \fB/var/run/openvswitch/\fIprogram\fB\[char46]\fR\fIpid\fR\fB\[char46]ctl\fR, where \fIpid\fR is \fB\fIprogram\fB\fR\(cqs process ID\[char46]

.ST "Ingress Table 11: ARP/ND responder"
.PP
.PP
This table implements ARP/ND responder in a logical switch for known IPs\[char46] The advantage of the ARP responder flow is to limit ARP broadcasts by locally responding to ARP requests without the need to send to other hypervisors\[char46] One common case is when the inport is a logical port associated with a VIF and the broadcast is responded to on the local hypervisor rather than broadcast across the whole network and responded to by the destination VM\[char46] This behavior is proxy ARP\[char46]
.PP
.PP
ARP requests arrive from VMs from a logical switch inport of type default\[char46] For this case, the logical switch proxy ARP rules can be for other VMs or logical router ports\[char46] Logical switch proxy ARP rules may be programmed both for mac binding of IP addresses on other logical switch VIF ports (which are of the default logical switch port type, representing connectivity to VMs or containers), and for mac binding of IP addresses on logical switch router type ports, representing their logical router port peers\[char46] In order to support proxy ARP for logical router ports, an IP address must be configured on the logical switch router type port, with the same value as the peer logical router port\[char46] The configured MAC addresses must match as well\[char46] When a VM sends an ARP request for a distributed logical router port and if the peer router type port of the attached logical switch does not have an IP address configured, the ARP request will be broadcast on the logical switch\[char46] One of the copies of the ARP request will go through the logical switch router type port to the logical router datapath, where the logical router ARP responder will generate a reply\[char46] The MAC binding of a distributed logical router, once learned by an associated VM, is used for all that VM\(cqs communication needing routing\[char46] Hence, the action of a VM re-arping for the mac binding of the logical router port should be rare\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Logical switch ARP responder proxy ARP rules can also be hit when receiving ARP requests externally on a L2 gateway port\[char46] In this case, the hypervisor acting as an L2 gateway, responds to the ARP request on behalf of a destination VM\[char46]
.PP
.PP
Note that ARP requests received from \fBlocalnet\fR or \fBvtep\fR logical inports can either go directly to VMs, in which case the VM responds or can hit an ARP responder for a logical router port if the packet is used to resolve a logical router port next hop address\[char46] In either case, logical switch ARP responder rules will not be hit\[char46] It contains these logical flows:
